# natural-language-processing

## Description

This repository contains many sub-projects. I have pursued these projects as a means to learn natural language processing. I have 
approached this field of natural language processing with only deep-learning as the tool. I do not have any linguistics knowledge, and
none of that has been used in any of the projects. I believe, and also as has been shown by many deep-learning applications now, that 
inputting in human knowledge may seem to be better at problem solving for a specific domain, but in the long run letting the achines 
figure out the patterns for themselves works for the best.
