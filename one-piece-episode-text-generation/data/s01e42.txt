Do you know what the difference Is between you and me? Nose Chin Oh, the webs! It's our very race! It's our very race! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue! His teeth must be His teeth must be He bit that column to pieces! He bit that column to pieces! He bit that column to pieces! He bit that column to pieces! BURSTING OUT! MERMAN ARLONG FEARSOME ATTACK FROM THE SEA! BURSTING OUT! MERMAN ARLONG FEARSOME ATTACK FROM THE SEA! See now? This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! This is the true power we mermen are born with! The Heavens only gave you humans enough strength to exist below us. You are inferior creatures! You are inferior creatures! From the very moment we were born, everything was different! Allow me to show you just how different we really are. Sure, show me. But I won't lose to the likes of you. 'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King! 'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King! 'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King! Pirate King? Don't make me laugh. You think a mere human like you can become someone like that? Can you bite through that column with your power? To simply bite through a solid stone column like he did no human could do that. Those teeth wouldn't just leave scars if he got bitten It'd go through and break his bones, too! So what?! Don't try showing off with things that don't matter! I can break that column without having to bite it. Oh! Well said, Luffy-aniki! You got it! In the end, the results the same! You're so stupid! The whole human race is pathetic! You can't even save yourself in the ocean. You can't do anything! And when I can't do anything, I have others to help me! Huh? He can use swords, too? Take that, and that, and that! What the hell are you doing now? Take that, and that, and that! You're just waving them around. You're just waving them around. I'm not interested in fooling around with you. This is boring. Then eat this!! Then eat this!! Arlong's teeth broke! Of course I don't know a damn thing about swords, you dumbass! Wha what's he talking about? I don't know how to navigate, either. I can't cook. I can't even lie! Hey. I know that I need others to HELP me if I want to keep on living! You sure are useless How pitiful. And such a pathetic guy is their captain? They must really resent you. Why should they risk their lives to save someone like you? Someone they can't be proud of, why should you be their captain? What can you do? I can beat the crap out of ya! That goes without saying, piece of shit If you get yourself killed, I'll kill you. Yeah! I'll back you up! Yeah! All right! Kick his ass, rubberman! Go Luffy-aniki! Go get him! SHUT UP! You've got to be joking, weaklings! Eh? His teeth grew back! Because I'm a shark. My teeth will grow back over and over with stronger ones everytime! My teeth will grow back over and over with stronger ones everytime! However many times As many times as I need. This is a trait that the Heavens have given to me. COOL! Are you beginning to understand just how superior I am? Are you beginning to understand just how superior I am? TWIST GUM! Whoa, stop that! Luffy-aniki! A-Arlong-san it hurts M-my kinsman! M-my kinsman! Why you, rubber bastard How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield! How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield! How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield! How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield! How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield! What're you talking about? You're the one who attacked him. You had me worried there. Stand still, rubber bastard! Heh, I just thought of a good idea. An idea? What could it be? Does he have some kind of special attack? TWIST GUM! They came out! Idiot, I told you that it doesn't matter how many times you break my teeth. Don't you get it yet?! Luffy-aniki, could your idea have to do with..? Look! Now I have 'em, too! I-It wasn't a special attack?! I figured he'd do something stupid like that. How long do you intend to keep fooling around? Ah! I was bit by a shark! 'COZ YOU'RE FOOLING AROUND! Who's fooling around? I'm dead serious! TWIST GUM! Bitten again! How's that? Getting bit by your own teeth? Sha-hahaha! Even if they are mine Your jaw's far too weak! Listen, sharks tear flesh and limbs from the body of its prey. That's what a shark's true power is! No! Aniki's bones will be broken! No! Aniki's bones will be broken! No! Aniki's bones will be broken! No! Aniki's bones will be broken! No! Aniki's bones will be broken! Luffy! CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO I-Is his arm alright? He was one step away from being eaten! I can't imagine what it feels like to be bitten by that beast's fangs. Aniki's elbow, you think it's okay? Huh? Where is he? Luffy! In the water! The water? Oh! A shark! That's ARLONG, dummy! Huh? He dove down. This is bad. They grow more powerful in the water! No one can surpass my speed in the water. This is a special trait that only we mermen have. Is he running away? SHARK ON DARTS!! SHARK ON DARTS!! What the! A torpedo? Something shot out from the sea! Oh? You dodged that well. But dodging is just dodging, the next one will send you to hell! SHARK ON DARTS!! W-What's that shark freak made of? He even crushed the floor! SHARK ON DARTS!! Hey, Luffy! Hide! He went back into the water! Aniki, hurry and hide! He's gonna attack again! RUN!! No. What are you saying, you moron?! You wanna just stand there and be an easy target? Go and hide! No! I'm gonna break that nose of his! Bring it on! Sharky! Heh. You've got guts! Or, maybe you've finally realized that you have no escape? What part of ''hiding'' do you not understand, Luffy? You just got lucky before and barely dodged it! But if he hits you this time, you're doomed! GOMU GOMU NO What's that stance? Does he really think that'll stop him? Does he really think that'll stop him? I have twice the distance to accelerate. I'll pierce your heart this time! SHARK ON DARTS!! Stabbed! What? Is he dead? No, he got away in time! I stopped your li'l trick, so I guess you can't use it anymore! SHARK ON DARTS!! You dork, haven't you used enough of that? You're finished! Take this! GOMU GOMU NO Fishing! Let's fish! And now YARI! He did it!! Good job! Oh? Is he dead? Arlong's eyes have changed! That's what people said happened to the ''Sea King's'' eyes when they were attacked that he changed and went berserk! Arlong with those eyes I've never seen him like this! You inferior human! How did you do this to me, a merman!? Man, that shook me up. I don't think he's hurt, but he sure is angry. What's that? Kiribachi! With huge teeth! Luffy-aniki! Run! Watch out! He won't stop. There,s no way out of this! Luffy-aniki! Run! Watch out! He won't stop. There,s no way out of this! It's dangerous!! It's dangerous!! They went inside. Top floor left window. That room is That was close. Now you have no where to run. This is the top floor of Arlong Park. Looks like your last moments have come. What's with this room? It's full of paper. Not just any ordinary paper! This is the map room. The room for that girl to draw her maps. The cartography room! Nami's room? All of them are sea maps that Nami drew for me. It's impressive, isn't it? Her eight years of work. My treasure. We know the sea like the back of our hands, but it's hard for us to make maps. We needed a skilled cartographer. Then I found that girl, with her talented eye! That girl's a genius. You won't find anyone who can draw more accurately She's too good to serve you humans! Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever! Nami is our nakama. Nakama? Just stay out of our way! You rubber bastard! What? What's with that look?! She's Nami is OUR NAVIGATOR!
