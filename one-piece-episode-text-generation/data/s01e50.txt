By duel, You insinuate a face-to-face discussion? If you gain, I will return the glasses to you. Not!! You would not be Daddy the Father? Indeed. A duel! I heard spoken about a duel! Daddy the Father was defied by somebody! He told to Daddy the Father? The most gifted bargain hunter with the gun, it is Daddy the Father. There are still the insane ones in East Blue? I ask for myself what a kind of imbecile would like to face somebody like him! This face Courage, length-nose! Am not afraid to lose, one will bury you in a quiet place and your funeral will be prepared! How did I arrive from there there? I am weak? The rules are simple! After 10 pas, one is turned over and one draws! Hum Of agreement. What you insane, you? Nami! To defy are Daddy the Father, stupid for you or what? Keep silent yourself it arrived like that!

Species of coward, species of microbe Already, since the beginning you did not want to beat you, not truth? I am sorry Forgive me! Here is my true nature Even if you take my life, that will not be useful to you with nothing. Of agreement? Of agreement? It is my only wish With Wait! Nami? Ah, yes! If it is money which you want, it will give you all that you want! Then, I beg you, do not draw. Save my life, please! You Why you hide behind a woman? In any event You make error. Forget what I said. It has nothing to do with all that! If you draw on me, does not imply it then! Usopp Please, I beg you. Usopp? You are called Usopp, it is that? Yes. Not possible Hein? You would know a pirate of the crew of Russet-red Hair named Yasopp? Yasopp? It is the name of my father. You You already met my father? I see his son Dad? In connection with this day Until now, I never spoke with somebody about this day. But for you, it is different. That occurred in a port as this one one day when the weather was hot Allons-y, Lieutenant Masterson! A match in a round! One! Two! Three! It gained! Yasopp gained! How? Its adversary was a sniper except par of the Navy. It was an obvious victory. It is of Yasopp very spit! Yasopp, finish it. Yes, y' has anything more pitiful than somebody who lost a duel like that! Kill to me. I lost this duel, I must die. Ah, it is very noble of your share. What do you make? It is your daughter? Return to me that You are a Lieutenant of talented Marine but, by keeping that on you, you become rather sensitive. Do not make me morals, pirate! You are right! Ah, played well Yasopp! It was nothing. This wound proves that I am not yet rather extremely. But your adversary was Daddy Masterson! What enabled you to gain, it is your talent. None among us of it would have been able Afflicted, chief Thank you to have looked at the duel in silence. They is good. Want you, Lieutenant? The family? It is not really my field. I have a son you know, his name is Usopp, I did not see it since years! I weighed the anchor by leaving it whereas he was yet only one baby. Why? You did not like your sons? It is not that the problem. This flag pirates Jolly Roger called me! You ace well done Yasopp! In any case I did not can anything make for my son. A father as useless as me, like me, that is enough! You should remain close to your daughter. Does not leave it all alone. Good, of course, I am a little badly placed to say that to you. I lost the duel. Yasopp, finish with me! I do not want your pity! Not thank you. If the Navy captures a pirate, it must carry out it. For a pirate, to kill or not depends on its mood. Good-bye! History of an elite of the Navy which is reconverted as an bargain hunter, it was thus that Dad Dad lost against a pirate, and it saved your life? You lie, hein Papa? But it is brilliant! Your father is a brilliant type! He beat Daddy! Moreover, he did not forget you! There are chances that it is crossed during our voyage. Usopp? Ahh, I include/understand what you feel. Not, it is not for that It is not because of that I cry! Is it normal? To tell did the history where you come very close to death? To tell such a history with a coward like me? You said that to me to give myself courage! A history which normal people would have hidden at the bottom of them! Even by knowing that I am if loose, you told it to me How my father carried out his life It is that? That irritates me to be weak and loose! Carol Your Dad is a very large warrior. Somebody moreover more extremely, one can always find some However, I ever saw as strong and nice somebody as your Dad I I cannot lose the face like that! If I do not gather all my courage, I will be a shame for your Dad. Daddy, gives me a chance, I will put my life concerned this time and I will not flee like presently! Included/understood. This time, it will be a true match. Chosen the weapon with which you are more at ease. Eh well, with that Let us see Prove to me that you are able to touch this whale. The whale over there? If you miss Ah, you will draw me a ball in full heart. Usopp! This time, it is about a duel where his life is risked! Impossible How could you the touch with a weapon like that? Co As usual If I draw as usual, that should do it. Yeah Concentrate! It missed it! Stop Papa! Do not draw, Papa! And why I would do it? Usopp touched its target! It is true! It touched the crown! Usopp! What a talent! It is the son of Yasopp very spit. If you do not forget this courage, one day, you will be able to become like your father! Goes on Grand Line. Yasopp is without any doubt over there. Daddy Be rather good for you, Ossan! Oh, but it is That is appropriate to me. Hello. Dad! Carol, you do not have the right How can you say hello, is not necessary to be too familiar! Forgiveness, Dad As a girl of Dad, I want to become a beautiful woman, then forgives me! You are already beautiful as you are now! But I want to even become still and more beautiful! After being fallen in disgrace, he fights to protect those which he likes. I want to become a man as courageous as Daddy. I will become a true warrior one day and I will be able to find myself face to face with my father! Yes! Sanji! I sought you Sanji Since ten years!
