Usopp, just a while ago you were Wellit's okay Help out! You! Geez, what's he thinking? Meanwhile, I gotta keep this bastard busy! Franky, we furled the sails as you said. Hurry or the warship will catch up with us. Not yet. We haven't named the ship yet. The ship's name?! At a time like this?! That's right, a ship without a name won't be any good at sailing. How come? Well, its gotta be something like Lion. Yosh! I just thought of an awesome name for it! The Polar Bear Lion! That's such a weird name for a ship! Then, The Tiger Wolf Lion! Stop that animal enumeration! It's like some sort of curse! Squid! Octopus! Chimpanzee! Without Lion on it?! Well, Lion is good for a ship. Even though, the guys from Galley-La didn't get it. This big head should do fine. Yeah, it's a nice sunflower! That's not it, idiots! Well, I don't blame you for your mistake But, this is the ship the future Pirate King will ride. That's what you were hoping for, right Franky? That's right. One appropriate for sailing the seas like a wild beast and reaching the summit! A wonderful sun indeed. That's not it, idiot! A strong ship as bright as the sun that can cheerfully overcome 1000 seas Something fit for those words. I told you no, Bakaburg! How does this name for the ship sound, Franky? Thousand Sunny! That's so cool! That's much better than the Dango Gorilla Lion name I just thought of! Are you playing shiritori?! Shiritori = Japanese Word Chain Game That's even better than the Lionel Master name I thought of. Better than my Being of Darkness And my Monsieur Sunflower. Have you all lost your minds?! A ship that can sail a thousand seas sounds nice So does the sunny part. Wait up you guys! This is only the beginning. The certain name for it is one I prepared! This ship's name will be! The New Battle Franky Lion Gang Champion! Let's go with the Ice-ossan name, I like it! Thousand Sunny, is a good name. Lion Gang Champion! It's a pleasure Sunny!

You'll get hurt! We're dead! Coup de Burst The ship! Got away flying! They made it Awesome! I remember this sensation! Merry. It uses three barrels of cola, but it can send us flying 1 km away. There's not a single thing The Going Merry you were riding could do that this ship can't! It's better in many ways! However, that ship's brave soul lives in The Thousand Sunny! If it gets damaged, I'll fix it up as good as new! Anything related to the ship's maintenance and weapons, you can leave them to me! Starting today, this is your ship! Geez They got away As expected from my grandson. He decided not to come with us after all. It seems so. However, the King of Snipers promised that everyone will visit Elbaf someday. I'm looking forward to it. We can wait patiently; a Giant's lifespan is 300 years after all. That was some work! Indeed. Well, time to go back to headquarters. We're definitely coming too!

But you liked that picture, right? Since you enlarged it. Well, it's fine, besides They're keeping the promise they made to you If by any chance you take away Nami's smile, I'll personally go and kill you! That's the evidence.
