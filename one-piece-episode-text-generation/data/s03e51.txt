Nami was trapped on the Maxim Arch until the arrival of its two savers Sanji and Usopp. One already had to be made locate by the enemy since one moment. They know that one is there? How one makes now? Useless to worry some! When one is inside, one separate and one goes on the bridge. Nami-san find over there! During this time, after Eneru took with the trap its arm in a gold ball and made it fall from Maxim in the Ruins of Shandora, Luffy is raised again to regulate its accounts! Good! Shit! I do not manage to remove this gold testicle! Do not speak about testicle! Usopp arrives in time for to save Nami of this mud pit, but it is not size with to face the power of Eneru and it is on the point to remain there, when EL Sanji-kun! You bar!

Hurry to leave me from there! Oh, sorry. In any case it is necessary that one leaves from here! Why I am not able to release you?! I die. Cursed living Blue Sea. You believed that my Arch would be so easy to destroy? I know perfectly its mechanisms of propulsion. Even without electrical energy, there is a back-up system coming from my terre natale, Bilka who uses the power from two hundreds Jet Dials and it can maintain the Arch in the airs one hour whole. You can resist as much as you want! The end of this country is imminent! Look at this giant bean. If it is the same one as I saw since the ruins, then this ilonimbus is just above. Ruins L it Quoted of Gold?! You found it?! Yes. But, Eneru took all gold. In any way, ruins are in lower part of us. Ruins of Shandora Zoro and others are surely over there. Current location Current location Current location I am not sure of what you say in connection with the ground but I have the feeling which it goes us to arrive of the trifles if one remains there.

I know, but DECREE ALL TO BREAK! HE!! Yes. The clouds of flashes are quite again charged. The rat gave up. Really shameless. But it does not matter. No matter what it arrives, my official reception will be magic. Hein? Robin is not there any more. Zoro and Chopper either. Neither Wiper and nor God. Where did they pass? They had to climb. Oh, Robin had to take them along. Good, allons-y. He, Aisa? I do not know. Listen well. If nothing is done, this country Skypiea will be destroyed. The celestial island? Our village too? All. Each man, woman and child in the sky will turn over to surface. Luffy Ouais? The celestial island really will be destroyed? CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB As soon as one is left, I will see Wiper.

Go up on board boats! The sky becomes completely black! That there does it have? It is quickly necessary to leave. Chief Aisa is always over there! It did not return yet? Aisa is an intelligent girl. Let us hope that it is with one of the warriors. Yes. Go! Made quickly! Captain! If we do not use boats on the quay, there will not be enough of place for all! It would be too long to reach them You! Use emergency Dials to create a river! Yes, Chief! You all, please! You must join Cloud End on bank of the cloud and to flee towards Blue sea immediately! Eneru God with the intention to destroy this country! While remaining here, NONE will not survive us! Since six years, over all, we know that Eneru the capacity of us has to bring despair! And this time, it is for soon! What good is it to await a miracle?! Before requesting, before closing the eyes on reality, we must initially make what is in our capacity! We cannot hide us behind its victims to survive! If we do not do anything, it does not matter with which it fault, we will have lost our lives! Now, you must be solved to leave this country!
