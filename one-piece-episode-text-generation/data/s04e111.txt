Men, searching for romance, Pushed forward towards the Grand Line. The world is now In the Grand Age of Pirates! Where is the 100 million beri that was here? It was spent during the party, buying meat and sake. Spent? Well, since we'll get our ship, it doesn't matter anymore. Nami, since I'm out to play, can you lend me some money? I can't take it anymore! You'll get nothing! The Girl Searching for the Yagara! Great Investigation in the Water Metropolis. What? What is it, Aobire? A dream? You're very generous. Thanks for giving me this mizu-mizu candy! It's okay, since I received 10,000 beri. Now, I want to buy a medicine book with the rest. I see. Isn't that Strawhat-san? It's true! Oi! Everyone! The town's hero is here! Great banquet! Everyone had fun! Thank you! Keep up the good work! Yeah! Leave it to me! After all that happened with Nami, he's still an idiot.

If so, then you should come to my house. No, come to mine! Is that? No, to mine! The pirate Iceburg-san mentioned. In my house! In mine! That guy Maybe! Abi! Wait until you eat your breakfast! Stop searching for Aobire already. Abi This time, I'll bring him to my house! We're gonna have a better party at mine! Like I'll let him go with you! Strawhat! Please, listen to my request! My beloved yagara has gone missing! That's why, please search for him with me! Please Isn't that Abi from the photo studio? Is she still searching for it? It's been about 3 days since the Aqua Laguna, It's a bit pitiful. For a yagara used for transportation to overcome that big wave is just Don't compare my yagara to yours! My Aobire wouldn't lose to a wave like that! What'd you say?! Calm down, Abi. It's as you said, He might not have lost to Aqua Laguna but, If he hasn't come back in three daysit's just That's true. You shouldn't involve Strawhat-san in this. If you're also a citizen of Water Seven, You must also know what it's said about the yagara's Tsui village. Shut up! Shut up! I don't believe in a place that no one has ever seen! Besides, he appeared in a dream! Aobire said he wanted me to go help him! Hey Strawhat, You pirates only live for the treasure, right? Here. This is all of my fortune. If you find it, I'll give it all to you! Eh? You're gonna give me this? Only if you find it. Stop it, Strawhat-san. If by any chance, you get yourself into the Tsui village Shut up over there! Scary! I don't quite understand it, but A pirate who has a treasure right before his eyes just can't let it go. That's for sure. You said you'll give me That treasure of yours, right? Really? Yeah! Then it's a deal. I'm Abi, pleased to meet you! I'm Luffy. He's my mate, Chopper. Nice to meet you. T-the mame-danuki talked! Mame-danuki: Shapeshifting raccoon dog Who's a mame-danuki?! Then, what are we looking for? Didn't you hear me? My house yagara, Aobire! Look. He has a blue fin above his head. He has a blue fin, so that's why it's Aobire. It's easy to understand. Yosh! Leave it to me! W-why does the investigation place have to be here?! Because, you can see everything in the city. A big place, isn't it? I-I'm scared. Hurry up and get back to the city! Just wait. It's Zoro. Oi! Zoro! Over here! Over here! Can you hear me?! There's no way he can hear you! We're gonna fall! Dangerous, dangerous! You're the one who's dangerous! Search more seriously! How is this one, Robin? It's nice, you should try it on. Oi! Nami, Robin! Oi! That's right! Maybe if we ask Robin A yagara with a blue fin on its head, right? I understand, let's give it a try. Ojos Fleur! Robin, did you see it? It's a shame, but I couldn't find it. I see. Let's go Abi. Abi. See ya later, Robin. Yeah. That surprised me. Thanks to Robin, we know that it isn't on the island streets. Aren't you glad she gave us a hand? Hey Abi, can I ask you one thing? What's the Tsui village the townpeople were talking about? The yagaras', right? If they're suffering from a seriuos illness, There's a place they go to when their time is up, they say. It's a place they go after they die, I heard. That's the Tsui village. But But? When a human sees the Tsui village When they see it? They'll bring him with them to that world! It's a fairy tale, a fairly tale. Don't worry. Hey Captain-san, won't you be needing a sniper for future battles? These are all the strategies I have. I can't think of another. It fell for it! I won't lose to you! Damn it! Aobire, where are you? He's not here. Let's look for him in the backstreets. Okay. I thought I was dead. Oi! Luffy! Here's a guy that heard Aobire's voice. On the Aqua Laguna night, I heard a voice in the neighborhood that said, "I'm coming to help you now, so hang in there." That definitely was old man Aobire's voice. Abi. Yeah! Thank you, mame-chan. You're amazing. You can understand what the yagara says. Stop it. I'm not a mame, bastard. Now that we know that, Let's search in the neighborhood! Yeah! Hey, calm down. Like a weird siren! I'm searching this hard Why? How is it? Are you warm? That's not the way! Watch out! Dad. Is it true that Aobire's eyes can't see? Yeah. Because he's a hundred-year-old yagara. I can no longer cure him. No way. He's been very useful, that Aobire But, he no longer has strength. It's about time we prepare for the worst. But, is it okay for us to explain it to Abi? No! Not without Aobire. We can't take refuge with him. This happens every year. You understand, right? No! No! This is the central place, There's no way Aqua Laguna will affect him, Abi. Aobire Aobire! As I thought, he was swallowed by the Aqua Laguna. Or maybe Is there any fish that can drown? I said I was going to help him, right? If you give up, what're we gonna do? That's right, Abi. Leave the tears for later. I'm not crying! I see. Yosh! Let's go to where we started. Let's search there one more time. What's this? This is Aobire's Over there? It's the entrance to an underground water passage! It's here. Oi! Aobire! Oi! Are you here? Aobire! Oi! Aobire! Oi! What's wrong? The water We can't keep going with a yagara. From here, there's no water. Anyway, let's keep going forward. Yeah. You wait here. See ya. What's this? There's a town beneath the town? What's going on? The new buildings are built over the old ones. I heard it from my dad. What's that light? Abi! He's surely over there! Soon l will be. With Aobire! What's this? I-it's painful! Help me! Help me! Aobire! I'm alive. Luffy! Mame-chan! Are you alright? Thank God. W-where's this? W-what's wrong, Abi? Luffy. Aobire is here. It's the same place I saw in my dream! Could this be! The Tsui village?! That can't be! The Tsui village is a fairy tale! There's no way Aobire is dead! That's just a yagara legend! Thank God! So you were there! Aobire, come here. Let's go home together. Chopper. I'm sorry, Abi. Why're you apologizing? I really, really wanted to see you! It's fine if you lost your scarf, That doesn't matter anymore. Let's go together What'd he say? That, I cannot do. Why? With this, I'm now at peace. "Thank you for everything," he said. No! Don't go! Aobire! I don't want to! Aobire! I've been searching for you all this time! Take me with you too! Let go of me! Aobire! What? What is it? A yagara's voice. He's somewhat weak, but He managed to survive somehow. Aobire must have given him his scarf when he saw him. T-that's The scarf I gave to Aobire. I'm coming to help you now, so hang in there. Aobire tried to save this baby. That's why, he was in my dream Here. It's okay, I didn't fulfill my promise. Thank you, Luffy. Thanks to both of you, I could see Aobire one more time. I was really happy. Besides We managed to fulfill his last wish. We saved this baby. I see. Then Feed him a lot, and make sure he's healthy. Thank you. Hey, do you think that place was the Tsui village? Well, isn't it great? There are a lot of things we don't know about this world! Hey everyone, we have a substitute! Listen, I don't have anything to do with this house. You take care of these kids. Should I give these two. No way! Are you listening to me! Oi! Next Time on One Piece: The Mother is Strong!
