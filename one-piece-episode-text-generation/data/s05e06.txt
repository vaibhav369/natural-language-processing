Usopp, let's show them our cooperative attack now. What, did you come up with a good plan?! What's with this stance?! Now I won't slip. Collier Frit Collier Frit: Fried Meat Arubelle-chan. Will you give another chance to this artist? Shut up, you womanizing criminal! You two move, damn it! Sarco! Hang in there, Sarco! A-Arubelle Have you realized it?! Your attack is ineffective before our own attack! Arubelle-chan Sanji, how long are you gonna stay there, wake up! If you wanna surrender, now is the time. I still haven't released even 10% of my true power. Did you think we were recklessly skating all this time? What? What does that mean? This is what it means! So cold! Now, surrender yourselves.

Brindo has been caught by the Phoenix pirate crew! If you lay your hands on us, he'll be killed! Jiro, oi! I take back my words! Niisan is coming. Niichan? You said too much! All of you will now be sent to the other world! What do you mean by that?! You! I won't let you do anything strange! Oi, you! Why are you shining?! What's with this guy?! Well, watch and you'll see. When did he escape? What a troblesome guy. No way! What's going on? Is it a replication technique? How dare you kidnap my cute little brother? Little brother! Niisan! It's been quite a while since We used our Combination Play. Amazing! How did you do that just now?! We're merely using magnetism. We can cover a greater range by separating. And, we can instantly come together again by calculating the distance. It's the magnetic power that links our brotherhood! That is our Brotherly Love. Oi! Did you eat a Devil's Fruit? Why do we have this kind of similitude? That is because we are Twins! Twins are amazing! That's definitely strange! Brindo, which one is today's target? First, this guy is Puzzle the Phoenix, with a bounty of 100 million beri. He is Strawhat Luffy with a bounty of 300 million beri. Oh? This guy? And this is the Cotton Candy Lover pet, Chopper, with a bounty of 50 beri. What's with that 50 beri? It's almost nothing, niisan. Don't give me that! I object to 50 beri! Well, nevermind. Now, let's see if you can escape from our Combination Play. Oi! Strawhat! Look this way. Don't, Luffy! Behind you! Behind? Han Pass Han Pass: Repulsion Pass Fall into the sea. There's no match for our brotherhood! Luffy! Gomu Gomu no Rocket Niisan! Luffy! Amazing! Strawhat! Do you give up? Campachino! What the? Someone's here? How much longer must I wait? Where's my party?! Where's the flag?! So damn hot. What's with this place? Who are you? What, you're not Campachino. It isn't time yet but Want some? Well, make yourself at home. Sorry about that. I'm waiting for my family to come to my birthday party, but I've lost sight of my party leader, and he hasn't come back yet. What a coincidence. I've also lost track of my nakama. I'm currently looking for them. So, you too. Thank you. Geez, I wonder where they are and what they're doing. And I wonder where you came from. Gomu Gomu no Sensei! I'm okay. You two, if you don't return the flag, we'll beat you up for real! Brindo, Papa is getting angrier and hotter. Let's end this quickly. He's a Devil's Fruit user so if he falls into sea, that's the end of him. Gomu Gomu no Gatling Luffy! Captain! No use, he's too far! Like I'll fall! Jiryoku Han Pass Jiryoku Han Pass: Magnetic Repulsion Pass That was close. Strawhat It's impossible to escape from us! You're some persistent guys, aren't you? Gomu Gomu no Twin Pistol Han Pass I'm on my way, Luffy! Jiro, watch out. Jiro! Are you okay? Captain! Oi! Turn the ship! Please pick up Luffy! That's impossible. While on the Frozen Highway, the ship won't listen to us. Luffy. Ignore those that forget about you. This is to be expected from them. They must be relaxed and playing on the ice now, geez. How is it? That's the collection I'm so proud of. Collection? That's right, those are the flags of the pirates I've hunted so far. Wonderful, isn't it? What an annoying hobby you have. C'mon, don't say that. It came at last. Maybe if you see this one, you'll understand too. This flag belongs to the Strawhat crew, a bounty exceeding 600 million. How is it? Bastard! Why the hell do you have that flag?! Quite a precious pirate flag, isn't it? It's even colder here! You were planning to imprison us here all along, weren't you?! Even the walls are made of ice. But, with this cold, I kinda feel like sleeping Don't sleep! If you do, you'll end up frozen! Where have Robin and Zoro gone to anyway?! Next Time on One Piece: Mansion of Great Chaos! The Enraged Don and the Captured Crew I'm gonna be the Pirate King!
