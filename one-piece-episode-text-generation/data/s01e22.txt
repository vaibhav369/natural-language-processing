Some of 'em have already starved to death. Water Right away! We'd know better that those pirates will be attacking us later on! We won't aid them! We refuse! Refuse? Don't misunderstand. I'm not ordering food. I'm giving you an order. Nobody.. ever Disobeys me! Sanji-san. Sanji-san, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. Bastard! Look what you've done! Hey, Sanji! Where're ye off to?! The kitchen. I've gotta prepare food for 100 men. Sanji-san! Sanji! WHAT?!! Yes. That's how it should be. You're being Krieg's little puppet, Sanji! I'll never let you get into the kitchen! I've had enough of your nonsense! Do it. If you wanna stop me, do so. I'm aware. I know that he's a hopeless bully. But that's none of my business. I don't care. I don't care what happens after they had their meal. Not a care in the world. I'm a chef. Nothing more. When people are hungry, I offer them food. That's all there is to it. For a chef, Isn't that enough? Patty! Hey, take him outta here! Sanji. You've often given food to the customers that I drove away, haven't you? I don't care who's right or wrong, but I can't allow this to happen. I can't let you do as you please anymore. I'll protect this restaurant. I'll protect this restaurant. Luckily, there's only one enemy. What can alone Don Krieg do to all of us? Pirates come to this floating restaurant everyday. I'm always prepared for anything. That's Did you enjoy your meal, Krieg-san? How about it? Since you've finished your meal How about some metal for dessert?! SYRUP MEATBALL! Don! I think I broke the door. The boss will be mad at me for that. It's ok. We're protecting this place. It's no major damage. What are we gonna do about those people on Krieg's ship? I dunno Why don't we just put some butter on their ship and cook it up? That sounds delicious. Stupid cook. Giving me such an awful dessert This restaurant's despicable! DESPICABLE! That armor It can shoot? Do as I say! I'm the strongest man there is! These arms are stronger than anybody's! My super-alloy armor is Tougher than anything! And I've got a Diamond Punch, which can destroy everything! An army of 5000 men! I've never lost a battle in my life! I'm the perfect person to claim the title of 'Don'! Out of the way, boy. I ordered you to get the food ready! Now hurry up and do it! Nobody disobeys me! Here's food for 100 men. Help him get it on the ship. Owner Zeff! What's the old man doing? Isn't that a little risky? Z-Zeff is it?
