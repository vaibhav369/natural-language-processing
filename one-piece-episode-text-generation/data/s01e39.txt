We've got to think of something! Wait a minute! You guys are severely wounded. If you go into the water, what good can you do? You'll never make it. l'll go save that rubber boy. Youyou're going? His survival is the key to win this fight. I know it. I'll go with you! Me too! I'm going! No! We can't go in a crowd, the mermen will notice. There's no reason to endanger their fight. Gen-san! This is the only way we can do it. I can handle it. Are you alright with that? Forgive us thank you! We're counting on you! Please hurry! Wait! Gen-san, l'm going too. But Nojiko, your hurts They're fighting for my little sister! Gen-san! Okay. Come on. Hurry! Right! I'm sorry If onIy we had more strength We'II entrust Aniki to you. You freakin' fish bastard! Roronoa Zoro, can l ask you one thing? I've heard that you fight with three swords, why do you only have one now? One is just fine! You're still gonna lose! Hey, shut up! I haven't gotten serious yet! Hey, shut up! I haven't gotten serious yet! Truth is human swordsmen don't stand a chance against me. lt'll surprise you! Astound you! Shock you! Shit The pain's kicking in again, at the worst time Fever's getting worse, too I thought I could just waIk it off Nyu? Huh? Shit! l knew it. You haven't recovered from The wound that Hawk-eyes gave you..! Aniki! What's this? Pretending to be sick is a good strategy, very good! But I won't fall for that! Roronoa Zoro! Let me show you my true skill! Behold, my real skill! Six-sword fighting style! Hey! Don't fall over! Don't insult me! Aniki! I knew it! He's been enduring it all this time! You're right! Those were wounds that would keep a normal person from walking for half a year if they didn't kill him first!! What did you say? I knew it was strange that he could fight with such a straight face!! Stupid, stupid bastard Didn't l tell you to pay attention? l'm a 40th Level Merman Karate Master! Huh? What was that? Did someone just fly through here? Oh, Aniki? Cook-aniki! Cook-aniki!! lt's over now, Arlong-san. What should we do with Roronoa Zoro? Toss his ass into the sea. How pathetic How boring Nyu? lt's over? But they really did make a mess around here That's no big deal. lt's alright as long as Arlong Park still stands. You're right. You bastard! Roronoa Zoro! You bastard! Roronoa Zoro! He was scared to death before l got to show my skill! I would've been so famous if you had fallen by my blades! Well, it doesn't matter. Humans still can't compete against me Humans still can't compete against me Humans still can't compete against me Humans still can't compete against me and my wonderful, amazing six-sword style! You can't touch me! That's enough, Hachi. I understand how you feel, but if you get serious, it might get dangerous. You want to destroy Arlong Park? Huh? Huh? Oh yeah, l'm sorry. l just forgot myself for a minute there It's fine, forget it. Six-swords style, huh? You're full of crap. Aniki! Roronoa Zoro! Let me just make one thing very clear, Octopus. There is someone that l must meet again. And until that day Not even Death himself can take my life away! CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Shit! How fast can this long-nose run? His speed and stamina are incredible Chu~ If I can distract even one of Arlong's guys It should help Luffy and the others out! What agreat idea, Usopp-sama! You're so dependable and loyal, aren't you? But thats a gift, isn't it? Huh? He's not following me anymore? Damn, that's too bad! Looks like l left him in my dust He may look like a fish in water, but he's just a turtle on land! Heehee Turtle..! Yeah, yeah!! Turtle, turtle! If you really think you can catch me, try, try! I'll dust your ass again, you lazy, lazy turtle, yeeeah! Wouldn't that be you? The one who's being lazy, I mean. Wait! He's onIy been drowned for a whiIe. If we can get him back to the surface, we can resuscitate him. Shit! This cement is too hard. I can't swing very weII underwater Gen-san, we have to hurry! No use. It's too hard to break. We couId reaIIy use an air canister, There's no way we can take the bIock up to the surface That's it! That's it! He's still alive, that guy! Aniki! Cook-aniki! That fish bastard's punch is Level 40? Then the shitty old man's kicks I always took must've been Level 400. What's with you, Roronoa Zoro? Why do you keep pushing yourself to go on? I don't think you can defeat me and my six swords as you are. I think anyone in the world would say the same Shut up, it's none of your business This isn't good Aniki's condition The fever's probably making him lose consciousness. He's delirious. If that wound opens again, he'll die without a doubt. But he doesn't have time to think about that now! Right! If there's anyone who knows that, it's Aniki! l'll show you my San-tou-ryu Nyu? Yosaku, Johnny! Lend me your swords! Of course, Aniki! Catch! Shit I'm Iosing it. How many more minutes can I hang on? Aniki, here they come! Don't you want to use them? Hah! Now you'll see the barrier that two-handed humans will never surpass. Roku-tou-ryu! Aniki, watch out! Tako Ashi Kiken! Aniki!! SAN-TOU-RYU TOUROU HAGASHI! (Bleeding the Wolf!) NYU~ !! Got him! The six swords didn't touch him! Aniki's awesome! That takes such concentration and persistence as well! How could this be? I'm reaIly mad now! I'm going to kill you! Just think about it normally, would you? You cannot match six swords when you can only carry three yourself. Don't you get it!? Normally? That's a major miscalculation. What burdens you? After you become strong, what do you wish to find? I will I will become stronger together with her! 'Til my name is heard even in the Heavens! I'll become stronger! 'Til I become the strongest in the world, the King of Swordsmen! Three swords Six swords Numbers don't matter! I may only have three swords, but yours wiII NEVER be as heavy as mine!! The weight, is it? Now I understand. Your swords are heavier? Eh? But don't think that'll help, each of my swords weighs 300kg, you know! They're much heavier and more powerful than any of your swords, you moron! It's useless talking to an idiot Roku-tou-ryu, Tako Tsubo no Kamae! Shin Shun! Takoage! Shit! Takoage! Shit! TAIKAI! That's dirty! Aiming for his wound! Watch out! Aniki!! Aniki's gonna be killed! You won't hit the ground alive. Roku-tou-ryu, Ougi! Roku-tou no WA-RU-TSU! Touch these for second and you're mincemeat!! You don't have a chance! Aniki! The pain! Aniki! That jerk, he spun with me in the air and did somersaults on my swords! Then he cut my hands like some kind of circus trick! Now I'm REALLY PISSED, and I'm going to destroy you! Aniki he's in so much pain That probably opened his wound again. Ah if only I could suffer in his place! A wound that'd make an ordinary man unconscious l won't lose to it. Roku-tou-ryu! Tako Tsubo no Kamae! This is the end! A wound that would kill an ordinary person I won't lose to it! Shin Shun! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes l can't allow myself to be ordinary! TATSUMAKI!! Hachi! How? San-tou-ryu How could..? Octopus jerk Now do you understand How much heavier my swords are? You satisfied? Enough tears. Enough talk. lt's time to make up my mind! l've got to go! They're all fighting.! I'm sorry, Octopus, but I'm not impressed. I have to hurry and rescue Luffy. Aniki, look out! You fiend! How could you do that to Hachi?! You fiend! How could you do that to Hachi?! Bastard! Yeah, you thought you'd gotten rid of me that easily, eh? Hm? I didn't think there was anyone who could stand up to my punch, not in all of East Blue. Oh, I bet you'll find plenty who could. Especially in a certain sea restaurant. You've been fooled. Aniki, don't move! Hey, stop! In your condition, your ass is as good as dead if you go underwater. Shut the hell up! He's almost done for! He can't wait for your fight to finish! Yeah, I know about that. I know there's no time left. That's why I'm stopping you. You're the one who should shut the hell up! So you don't complain about me doing THIS! Interesting! He wants to challenge a merman in the water? I've never met a bigger fool! You dumbass! An underwater battle is just what they want! That's l'm pretty sure he's the head of Cocoyashi Village His neck's stretched out I'm sorry this is all we can do to help. This way, if we can at least get your head out of the water, we can resuscitate you. Come on, breathe, it's not too late yet! Come on, l can't hold on much longer! They couldn't move the stone, so they moved his head. They need me to break the stone to get him free. Then that old man can take care of it from there. Gyojin Karate, Wan Tou Giri! This is getting interesting What do you humans intend to do next? Come back to life Please, hurry! He's so stubborn!!
