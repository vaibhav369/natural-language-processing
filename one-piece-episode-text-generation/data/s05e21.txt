The Pirate King, Gold Roger. The words that he spoke before his death, influenced people from all over the world to Go out to sea! My Treasure? If you want it, it is yours! Search for it. I left everything I had in that place. Men, in search of romance, entered the Grand Line. The world is currently in the Grand Age of Pirates! Hey Bearsy Bearsyâ¦ The Risky brothers are bringing the coffin here. When it arrives, please send it to masterâs dance hall. Kay'? You got it or not? Yes- Donât answer like that! Itâs not cute! Iâm going to collect the treasure off their ship now. So if anything happens, let me know. Understand? Thatâs it. You look cute when you keep quiet. Have a nice tripâ¦ Hey, did you just mumble something? If that Gecko Moria saw the old man who asked us to go here, then the Curly browed cookâs disappearance may be related to him too. That stupid cookâ¦ He got what he deserved! But to think one of the Shichibukai was out here What are we going to do if one of our shadows is stolen? Now that sounds interesting. I don't know anything. I know Iâve promised that old man that Iâd beat up Moria, but we should put that off, right? Like I said, your friends are probably in bad shape. Furthermore you donât even have time to worry about others. Stop that and show us the way. You little Puhi~! Usopp! Chopper! Watch out! Behind you! Usopp! Chopper! Youâre in equal danger. Stop that! You bastard, whatâre you doing to your comrade? The enemy is that woman.  Beat HER up! I don't know who or where this lady came from, but even if itâs an order from the master, I'd rather die Than kick a woman! Hey, Puhi~! Whatâve you done this time? Spit it out! I already told you that I donât know anything. Itâs so easy to see through you! But itâs strange, we donât even hear their voice Maybe they were strangled. Why are your predictions always so gruesome?! This is strangeâ¦ Zoro has disappeared too. Disappearing Straw hat Crew! The Mysterious Swordsman Appears! Damn! I wonder what couldâve happened. Itâs strange. Whereâd those guys disappear to? I wonder if it is the work of the ghosts? It would be nice if they arenât injured though. Stop acting worried and think about how we can save them! Whereâd they go? Zoro and Sanji! Whatâre you doing at a time like this? Hey, if there is armor laying around, isn't wearing it a man's romance? Damn! Romance? No wonder. After gaining a metal body, have you lost your heart as well? Forgive me. I never intended to change my heart to metal. Yay! Play a song! Losing such an important thing has blown a piercing wind through my heart Please listen to this. Cyborg's metal wandering heart! Do these guys understand the situation? Hey, there is a hall up here. Really? Could this beâ¦? Robin! Are Usopp and the others there? Nope. More importantly The inside of the hall almost looks like it's outside. Whatâs this place? It looks like an arena. Itâs not quite that simple.  Puhi~ Puhi~ Youâll find out eventually that getting away is now impossible. Franky! Who is it? The armor is moving. Must be a zombie. And itâs moving with spears stuck inside its body. The zombies are armed quite well. Itâs not a surprise! Strong Right! The wall! Youâre worse than a normal swordsman. Weapon's Left! Wasting my time! What is he? What? Franky wasâ¦ Can't be I wonât die from getting hit by this corpse. He keeps standing up. Heâs totally different from the other zombies up till now. Now you will feel true terror. This is what is truly scary about zombies. Look at him, he is so far away. They donât even feel pain. In life, all of these General Zombies were warriors that had made names for themselves in battle. A knight! A villain! A samurai! A pirate! A gunslinger! Just think of this, coupled with the relentlessness of the undead. Itâs impossible for you guys to win. Not a single one of your friends is safe. Take that! Damn you! Wall Zombie! Itâs blocked. Means thatthereâs no turning back. Speaking from my experienceâ¦ Iâd say this is beyond tough. Itâs full of armor. Attacking one has no effect, but if we attack them all itâs like suicide. I see. Thatâs right. And this isnât even the last battle. If we can escape this hall, weâll probably end up in the courtyard. Alright, letâs split and meet there. I donât want anyone else to disappear. Thatâs right. Get them!! Letâs go! Yeah. Lola! Whereâd she go? Lola! Ab-sama! Stop it Lola! Just give up! I told you Iâd marry this girl. Ab-sama is mine. I will never let her off, that Cat Burglar! Stop it, Lola! Iâm on my way! Stop it! I wonât forgive anyone that lays a finger on a lady. Whatâs going on? Isn't that penguin an enemy? That way of fightingâ¦ Could it be? Hey, you fool! Heâs acting bigâ¦ Whatâre you doing? That lady is our enemy. Iâll teach those who mistreat a lady some Table Manners. Shitty Zombies! That dog-penguin Thereâs no mistake about itâ¦ #AnimeSS@irc.rizon.org The ship of the man who defeated Crocodile, Straw Hat and his crew. Iâm excited to find what theyâre hiding. Hey, Let me out!  Is anyone there? Answer me, darn it! I canât see anythingâ¦ Where the hell am I? What do you want? Let go of me! Whatâre you doing? You fool! Who are you? Answer me! Whatâs with the light? Hey! Whatâs the meaning of this? What?! Strong Right! Donât get cocky Treinta Fleur! Out of my way! Alright, now. Damn you. Stop wasting my time, you damn zombies! Clutch! Stay out of our way! No matter how hard we hit them, they don't seem to be giving way. DamnNo matter how many times we knock em' down, they keep getting up. Persistent, geez! Gomu Gomu No Gattling Gun! Ittouryu Sanjyuroku Pound Hou! That move. Zoro! Hey, Zoro! What's your problem?! Thatâs dangerous! Itâs a shame for a warrior to have a scar on his back, but Iâm full of scars! Whoâre you? So you are Zoro, right? My nameâs Jigoroh! Jigoroh? What, so youâre not Zoro? Why are you using Zoroâs technique? Youâre too loud, pirate! Youâre the enemy. Iâll cut you true. You really resemble Zoro, are you his clone? You! Damn, there is no end to this! Franky! Grab hold! Damn! They're too persistent! If they are zombies thenâ¦ Fresh Fire! Prepare the buckets! What?! Crap! Once Fleur! Slam! Whereâs Luffy?! It looks like he isn't out yet! I canât see him when I look back. Itâs all because of his stupid armor. Darn it! He couldnât have disappeared too, right? Itâs no use waiting. The zombies will catch up soon. Hey! Straw Hat! It hurts. Bastards, let me out! What? Let me out you bastards! Open the lids and let me out, fools! A coffin? That voice. Luffy! Are you saying that Straw Hat is inside? Letâs go, Nico Robin. Yeah. What are you up to, you dumbass? That idiot got himself caught! Straw hat! I wonât let you. Hey, hey! Monkey!  Monkey!  Monkey! The rumored Spider Monkey, thatâs me! A giant spider?! This oneâs a monster spider. Free me, idiot, let me out! Ah, another one! Damn, the coffin Whatâre you guys going to do to him? Donât worry. The same will be happening to all of you too. You should worry about yourself! Iâm in front of you, The armored warriors are behind. With this, your crew will be annihilated! Hey you! You aren't going to listen to us? I won't let you touch that lady! Next time on One Piece: The Last Knight! |The Traitorous Zombie who Protects Nami I'll be the Pirate King!
