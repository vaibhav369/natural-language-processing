Therefore, the man with the other end of this Den Den Mushi is Den Den Mushi:Snail Phon One of Shichibukai! Ca makes a few days that I did not give you your orders. What does it occur? Mr. 3 Ca must be the owner of this Den Den Mushi. I see, I include/understand the situation. It is the den of the enemy. And this guy named Mr. 3 continues Vivi-Chan to kill it. Whore I do really not should have gone to drive out outside! They may find it beneficial to be left there. What is it that this silence? I asked you a question? Did you eliminate princess Vivi and the pirates from Straw hat? Yes, mission accomplished. I got rid of these bastard which knew your secrecy. Therefore, more need to continue them now. I see.

Cretin, if one takes some more, it will be rotted before it is eaten! Do you try to make run the boat? Oh, giants-Ossan! They came for our departure! For all the small human ones which came on this island, the imperative reason for which they did not reach the following island is in front of us. You took care on our lives with honor.
