What's happening? What is it? Did something happen? L-look! What?! The Gate of Justice is being closed! The sea currents that are blocked by the gate created whirlpools, and they're moving us off course! Is that why our aim is off? Don't get sucked into the whirlpools! What's going on? Stop going so slow, hurry! It's too late, everybody run! Idiots, why did you close the gate? What the hell are you doing?! The lever to open and close the gate is in the third tower of the Bridge of Hesitation There's no way it could have been any of us! That was better than I'd imagined! Sanji! Is that what you did before? Yeah. We can't get away from 'em with strength alone. Bingo. You're amazing, Sanji! Are you a genius? Don't just praise him. The whirlpools'll be dangerous to us too. That's right! We're gonna die! Be quiet, all of you! There's no ocean we can't pass in Merry! Nami-san's so cool~ That's right! We're counting on you, navigator!

Got it! The pirate ship is headed towards the waterfall! Fire, fire! What are you doing? Are you all stupid?! Hurry and sink it already! It seems they're using the whirlpools' spinning! What incredible speed! I can help too! Good luck, reindeer-chan! Go! Keep going on! Damn Damn them! I used all of Enies Lobby's power I used all the power of a national-level Buster Call! Why the hell Can't I get A single woman From those worthless pirates?! If it wasn't for me, There'd be nothing left for you! You don't have any more hopes! It was so painful you're crying? Save me Clutch! Di-Director! Well, that's that Franky! I need your help now! Yosha! Everyone, brace yourselves. Block them! Don't let them get out of the whirlpools! This might hurt the ship a bit, sorry 'bout that. Coup de Vent! T-the pirate ship is flying? Is that even possible? They got away from the battleships! Don't overlook this ship's experience Merry's the boat that went 10,000 meters into the air! Hissatsu! Hissatsu: Sure kill Chou Kemuri Boshi! Chou Kemuri Boshi: Super Smoke Star It's a smokescreen! Bastards Follow them! They can't outrun us! It's no use! We can barely even keep the ships from sinking because of the whirlpools! Fire! Fire! The Strawhats escaped! Yosh. We should go back too! Is everyone on? Yeah, we even carried on all the guys who can't move. Okay. In order to make sure you don't fall off the train, Everyone hang on! It's over. All of it Yeah. I'd heard stories, But I never knew the Buster Call was really this horrible. Well, now that Enies Lobby's gone, Those people should stop coming after Iceburg-san. Yeah. You two, don't do that! Without Paulie's rope, we would have all died! Paulie saved our lives! Shut up! Get off of me, you perverts! Paulie's just as innocent as ever He sure is You just stop it Well, Paulie's having trouble now Well, we should take care of him! I beg of you, please just leave Go, Puffing Tom! Y-you were here, sir? We'll follow them! We won't allow it to end here! No matter what the marines- No, the World Government must do- We'll stop the Strawhat pirates! No matter what! We'll make sure to capture the criminal, Nico Robin! We'll get more battleships, and more soldiers, and- It's fine. But Even with a national level Buster Call Looking at this fleet, As well as the state of Enies Lobby, It's obvious. This situation Was our complete defeat. You'll be okay up on its head? Yeah, this is my special seat. Don't fall. Thanks, monster-baasan. Thank you, Merry We got away because of you. I never thought that Merry would come to save us. But now that I think about it, we've always been protected by you. I'm so glad you're our nakama. Thanks, Merry. But you know You guys did some pretty unbelievable things. You burnt down the World Government's flag What? It's nothing special We were just getting back our nakama who was taken from us. You saved Robin too, so thanks. Well, it wasn't really anything special to someone as great as me. Anyway Is Our victory! Merry Merry. Merry! Your name is Going Merry. You are our nakama! Next time on One Piece: Thank You, Merry! The Snow on the Sea of Farewells I'm gonna be the pirate king!
