Ah! She's laughing. They raised the price again? Don't you think that's a little too high? Why you Next time the price is raised, I won't buy it, hear? Geez, it's just a newspaper! But if you get it all the time, it adds up! But if you get it all the time, it adds up! Well, you don't have to save up to buy your village from Arlong anymore So why keep worrying about money? Dummy! That's exactly why! I don't have that obligation anymore, so from now on, it's all for myself! so from now on, it's all for myself! I can't go around being some kind of cheapskate pirate, can I? I can't go around being some kind of cheapskate pirate, can I? I can't go around being some kind of cheapskate pirate, can I? Hey, keep it down! I'm in the middle of formulating my ''Hissatsu Tabasco-Boshi'' here! With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes What? Come on, just one? Never! This is Nami-san's tangerine grove. I won't allow you to lay a finger on it! NAMI-SAN! THE SECURITY GUARD OF LOVE IS ON DUTY! Thank you, Sanji-kun. She uses him like a tool, that dork Sanji. What the hell? It's just one little tangerine! Stingy Sanji. I SAID NO! Oh well, whatever. I'm in a good mood. The world's in such chaos right now. There was another coup-de-tat in Villa. Hm? A flyer? BOUNTY! STRAW-HAT LUFFY BECOMES WORLD FAMOUS! BOUNTY! STRAW-HAT LUFFY BECOMES WORLD FAMOUS! So, it seems to me, that what you are saying is that they won't be defeated by simply dispatching a military force. Correct. Since their formation, and subsequent defeat of Captain Axe-Hand Morgan, they have been quite active. Clown Buggy, 15 million. Pirate Fleet Leader Don Krieg, 17 million. And Mermen Pirate Leader ''Saw Nosed Arlong'' 20 million. Keeping in mind that the average bounty in East Blue is 3 million These are big-league pirates that are worth over 10 million. And he's taken them all out. And he's taken them all out. The initial price on his head will be $.30,000,000, which is a record figure, but a reasonable one. It would be wisest to take care of them quickly. To pluck this seed of evil before it takes root. Absolutley. Anyone who wants to run, do it now! For there is no room for weakness, here in this fortress of peace during the Pirate Age! It is not a crime for civilians to be weak. We are the heart of Justice! If there is deadly evil upon the seas, we, the Marines will exterminate it! In the name of ABSOLUTE JUSTICE! In the name of ABSOLUTE JUSTICE! Oujousama! Kaya-oujousama! Oujousama! What's the matter, Meri? Please, look! Please, look! Please, look! Usopp-san! Usopp-san! That back profile is definitely Usopp-san! It does seem to be, yes Hey, you look a lot healthier today, Kaya. What story should I tell you today? What story should I tell you today? Usopp-san is pursuing his dream I'm studying to become a doctor, so that I can help people. My dream and Usopp-san's dream The day when they'll meet again and become one will arrive someday. I'm sure of it. At last At last At last! Luffy-san is moving on with his dream! I'm Luffy! The man who's gonna become the Pirate King! See yaa! But The next time we meet, we may be enemies! CAPTAIN!! The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

With a huge bounty like that even the top Marines will be Iooking for us And tough bounty hunters after the money. From now on, we'II be in a whoIe new Ieague. Let's Go! Let's Go! To The Grand Line! Let's Go! Go! Go! Go! To The Grand Line! CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Crap. Cheap wine tastes like shit.

Really? l'm starved! Food! Food! Foo-food! Food! Huh? What the hell's that? Huh? Lemme see. Hawk-eyes! What are you doing here? Shut up. I have no business with you. Where are your superiors? Camping on an island such as this He's much too casual. Boooss!! Hawk-eyes! Yo, Hawk-eyes. Long time no see. I'm not feeling too good right now. You come for a match? I have no interest in challenging a one-armed man like yourself. However, I came across some interesting pirates. And it reminded me of something you told me a long time ago. A story about a small village, and an amusing little kid No way So you've come, Luffy! Well then, Hawk-eyes. I can't let you go just like that. So, Hawk-eyes! C'mon, drink up! Drink, drink! We're gonna party today! You seem to have already done so. Don't mind me. This is a time to celebrate! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon! CHUG! CHUG! CHUG! I like it! PARTY! PARTY! But, boss! You just said you had a hangover from drinkin' too much!! Idiot, Don't ruin this good pleasure Don't you think it is rather early? Don't worry about it! Let's get WASTED! Hey, did you hear? There's a price on Luffy's head! Whoo! Way to go! Hah, this village might get known for producing an infamous pirate. Not bad!! YOU FOOLS! Stop all this racket! S-Sonchou! What's to be happy about a villain coming from our town?! A toast! Yeah! Geez Everyone's getting into it. Look, Sonchou-san. Luffy looks so happy. A pirate is a pirate. I'm gonna be a pirate! But, that's his dream. Are you worried? A dream? Or fate? We're getting very close to the Grand Line. The only way to get there, is to go through 'Reverse Mountain'. That's a pain in the ass. Can't we just go straight there, from the sea? Nope. According to the old man's stories, it's the only way to get into the Grand Line. Why's that? It's extremely dangerous. That's why I asked! Why? I don't know any more than that! The reason is OK! I got it. Let's go head-on through the front! Are you even listening to me!? Because, won't it be more interesting? It'll definitely be more exciting that way! Argh Trying to explain things to you is driving me insane! But what's most important is, we should stop at an island and buy some meat. Meat, meat! On this island, there is a famous city. Loguetown. Loguetown? Are they famous for their meat? It's also called, ''The Town of the Beginning and the End.'' Or so I've heard. It's the place where the Pirate King, Gold Roger, was born. And also the place where he was executed. The city where the Pirate King died Wanna go? Yeah. I want to see it. The man who owned One Piece. The man who had everything in the world. The place where he was born and died
