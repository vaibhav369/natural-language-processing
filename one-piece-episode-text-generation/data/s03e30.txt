Our goal is the Sanctuary of God! Do not fear Eneru! The Large Karugara Warrior we will protect forever! OUAIS! You here is, Shandia! A little further, after having overcome Satori, Luffy and its crew took again the road in direction of the Sacrificial Furnace bridge. Meanwhile, Gan Fall, casualty, and Chopper, survivor of water, were saved by the strange ones birds of the island of Jaya. A band of Birds of the South But, why? Why are they so large? It is you who saved us? This man is God?! During this time, Nami, Zoro and Robin, reach the shore of Upper Yard and do one surprising discovered. It is a piece of the same island A piece of Jaya!

After all these efforts for to reach the celestial island and finally to discover that it is about the Country of Gold! It is to reward me to have summer a nice girl, not true? My God! You! I believed that this island of God terrified you. Hein? God? He has value? More what gold? You do not come from to say, Thank you, God? This chick becomes senile! Useless!

If it came you to the idea to try anything on this island  we will eliminate you how we will eliminate Eneru! Do these types intend to overcome Eneru?

Please, leave them quiet! I arrive! Remain where are to you! Prepare to take shaken your life! He insists I do not know if you will be able to leave this island. Who are these types? All that we know, it is that they have a tooth against Eneru God and against us too. Whore Ca fears, this island Let us carry on our road. Oh, my disease of I--must-not enter-in-this-jungle " begins again to me Good, I have the flagstone. How can you to think of puff out?! I cannot even rise! Ok, Luffy. We change the ideas into singing the song of Sanji! Ok. Give me your hand! NOT! It is not like that! I cover you! Profit to leave! Now! Something approaches! Somebody approaches! I am sure! They will not leave us to leave also easily! They arrive in group, in herd, horde [Note:Zorozoro = in group, with the file] CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB He, that done one moment that one sails, Sanji. He, Sanji! Ouais.

Why one turns? One goes where like that?! I have the tournis! Ca goes quickly! Not, imbecile One falls! A thing is sure, Milky Road is too is delirious! I will be sick He, it starts to make night. Will Ca be like that to the Furnace bridge? The sun lies down I do not manage to see through the clouds. There are also couchers of sun on the celestial island. Wiper, Kamakiri is by there! They need assistance over there! Chopper! Where are you? It occurred something, Chopper?! Answer me! He, it has there no more mast on Merry. What did it still adulterate? You ace nothing included/understood! It was made attack! Chopper! Afflicted to have been so long! You can leave now! You are there, hein?! Stop hiding you! Answer me, Chopper! It was perhaps done to cut out of pieces. Stop saying such horrors! He, Chopper! Be to you there or not?! What occurred?! Speak! R Nothing It did without anything terrible! Of agreement, agreement. You are large and strong. Now, say to us what occurred. One is again above the trees! This time, it is a giant tree! He, you should take that more with serious, Luffy. What is it? Ca does not feel good There is something with the end? I have like the impression that at the end of Milky Road, the Priests are in train awaiting us. It is brilliant! I adore this trick! One still will turn?! He, there is something in bottom. Over there! They is surely the Priests! Not, they are celestial sharks. Oh, then they are not the Priests. They are right some sharks He, He, He, He, be serious for you?! They are enormous! They will swallow us very believed! GOMU GOMU NO GATLIN GUN!! One is soaked! He, look at! They were found! It is the Merry Vogue! Ca must be the Furnace bridge! Hello, Nami-san! Robin-chwan! You missed me? I exceeded Ordalie of the Love! What? It was Ordalie what one faced? You were not too afraid? You reassure, now that the Usopp Captain is there! Mellorine! Mellorine! They have the air in form. Ah, here me is relieved. The mast is Party. Heu, Usopp I am sorry. I have do all that I could, but Ca burned everywhere, and Are He, you well? Yes. This guy with his lance flamer must be dangerous. But at least you did not cramé with! One will deal with the boat later. I will become the man on whom everyone can count! He, Chopper! How you are removed from this Priest? I made use of the whistle. The Knight of the Sky came to help me. Where is the odd one the pépé now? All that because of one whistle that it gave us, It fought for us. If the Knight of Sky had not come, the boat and me let us not be already more this world. I have full with tricks to ask him, But that will wait until it awakes. And thank you with you too. Luffy! Considering the state of the boat and the night which approaches, we will not be able to turn over on Angel Island before tomorrow. For the moment, let us go down in the forest and let us install the camping on the bank. Why? If us here are attacked, the boat will undergo even more damage. You should think of this type of things! Without forgetting that it is easier to fight on the bank that here. Of agreement, one camps! It is the festival! He, wait! One is in enemy territory, here! You want to camp?! Go, start with one barbecue of celestial sharks! They is delicious! Cretin, would swallow you anything! He, they is good. Silence! We will listen the report/ratio of each one! We went in the Forest Lost, where one fell on a Priest called Satori which made use of Bubble-Surprises. One galéré with these Bubble-Surprises which floated in the air without knowing what they contained. But the worst, it was this Mantra which it used to guess our movements. A Priest, name of Shura, emerged from nowhere while making use of its launch which burned all! Moreover, it could to envisage my movements. I tested all kinds of attacks on him, But he dodged them. The bird which it assembled spit of fire and started to burn the mast Then, it impaled the Knight of the Sky You passed dirty fifteen minutes, the guy. But, we discovered that this island was in fact a piece of Jaya. The Gold City does not have run at the ocean floor. It was propelled in the sky! Good! Thank you with all for your reports/ratios! We drew from invaluable information of all this! Bird fire-eater! Launch flamer. The celestial island is in fact what we thought cast, Jaya!! The Priests use something called Mantra to envisage our movements. This island is the Gold City that them Forces Alliées Saruyama sought! REALLY?! I have just said it! If not, it is what this history of Mantra? No idea. Perhaps a species of instinct. Instinct? Does Chopper, that suit you like that? Yes, it is sufficient for that it can swallow it. Its digestive system was touched. Gold, hein?! It is this kind of adventure that I waited! I am in a hurry to be there! Quite known as! Then one is ready! He, He, Luffy! You would have forgotten what did the warriors say? God will be furious. And it is alarming. One will not be bored, not truth? Pirates cannot leave to pass the chance to steal a treasure. And it is stuffed enemies over there. It will be necessary to survive. Ca promises! L them guy We must be wary of God! Do not come to feel sorry for you if you all are damnés! OK! HOWEVER, US HERE!
