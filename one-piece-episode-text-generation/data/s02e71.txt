It'll be alright. Those clouds As long as those clouds don't move, the weather will be fine all day. Call me if you see those clounds change at all. Now then Ever since we entered the Grand Line, things have been so busy that I haven't had much free time. Little Garden. Drum Island. Arabasta. I've managed to map out the entire route we've traveled. And there's also the local maps I stole- er, I mean got from the towns we stopped at. It's time to start drawing it. The dream I've had since I was a kid! My own map of the world! Hey guys! Let's clean this place up a bit while Nami-san's working. Aye-aye! Work hard! YOU'RE WORKING TOO! Cheater!

Damn, that hurt Bellemere-san! Bellemere-san, listen! Bellemere-san? I wanna know where the wind blows from. From the sea. The sea? Yup. The wind is born from the sea and blows over Kokoyashi Village, bringing us blessings. And it's not just the wind. Rain, clouds, and rainbows all come from the sea. Oh! Then where does the sea come from? Nami! Don't bother Bellemere-san so much! But, Nojiko! Nami, you really are a curious one. Nami! Nami! I heard you did it again. The bookstore lady came barking at me. Okay, let's go home. Dinner's ready. Hey, Bellemere-san What's beyond that sea? Who knows? I don't know a thing about what lies beyond the Grand Line. Even though you were a Marine? I was, but the sea is just too big. I want to see what lies beyond the sea. Nami Do you think I can make it? Beyond the sea? You're a strong girl, Nami. If you set your mind to it, you'll be able to go anywhere you want. Then I've decided! I'm going to travel the world's seas with my navigation skills! And I'll make a world map of everything I see! I'll do it! Yes. Someday I will complete a map of the world. Hey, Luffy! Watch this! Wow! That's so cool! Geez! You must be tired. Have you finished your work? No What's all this?

It is a one of a kind map recording our travels on the Grand Line. That's all I wanted! My dream is to complete my own map of the world. Get out! But Just Nami! What? Sorry. If sorry was all it took, the Marines wouldn't be after us! Just get out! If you don't leave, I'll fine you 100,000 beri! It's your fault. Why me? Geez, they'll just be in my way if they stay in here. Luffy, cheer up! Why do I smell rain? This is bad! Luffy! Luffy! We've got trouble! The clouds! Oh, a spider has ten legs. Kumo can mean either cloud or spider No, they have eight. Wait, that's not the point! Wake up! A hundred arms Usopp! Sanji, wake up! Zoro! Flower lady! Help! Nami! I'll fine you 100,000 beri! W-What should I do? It's done! Humm, Prefect! Am I a genius or what? What was that? Hey, what's going on!? Nami! Hey, what are you doing? Why didn't you tell me about this!?

Listen up! If that map I worked so hard on falls victim to the high waves Not one of you will escape. She really is scary! Atmospheric pressure rising, rain's stopped Nice work! You can all take a rest now! Oh. I'm going to continue with my maps, so keep watching the clouds, okay? You're still working on it? Of course! My goal is to draw a map of the world. I've only finished my first page. The real task is still ahead. Impressive resolve you've got. I love this Nami-san too~! You think there's gonna be a 100,000 beri fine again? Yeah. Have you been reading the whole time? Okay, full sail! Full speed ahead! AYE! So now, you guys have the helm. Oi! What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow? Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you With a small bit of courage, I gained something large So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.
