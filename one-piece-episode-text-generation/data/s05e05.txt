While heading to the New World, The bounty hunters known as the Atchino family appeared before the Strawhat crew. Coup de Burst After escaping from the Atchino family, the Sunny managed to get out of the Frozen Highway for the time being, but The soul of a pirate, the pirate flag, was stolen. A fluttering pirateâ¦ flag. This is bad! The pirate flag is gone?! The secret of the moving icebergs on the Frozen Highway turned out to be the strange Doom Penguins. And with the Strawhat crew split up, the Atchino family began its attack. Let's play. Oneechan. Sorry about that. I'm the Atchino family's second son! Brindo-sama! The Strawhats' Hard Battles! A Pirate Soul Risking it All for the Flag! Lovely Land? Love? That's right. The flag is now in Lovely Land. That's the stronghold of our Atchino family! Lovely Land! The defeated pirates are handed over to the marines with a smile on their faces. Yes! Lovely Land! Like I care about that! There's still plenty to explain about it, but Wait! Luffy! Well, it doesn't matter. You caught me off guard last ti But I won't get caught again. Oi, raccoon dog?! I'm not a raccoon dog! What a stupid captain. That's the reason why his precious pirate flag was stolen. Oi, pirate scum! Better get ready for the consequences! Just for covering that miserable captain of yours, I'll show you what hell is like. It's a shame, but if you can't trust me You'll never know what happened to the stolen flag. Gomu Gomu no Gatling Damn! I though I could keep up with him until he gets tired but this guy! He suddenly increased the speed of his attacks. He's getting closer and closer to hitting me! This is a cute ship. Name? It's Thousand Sunny. Thousand? No, I mean your name. My name? My name is Robin. Nico Robin. Nico Robin? Yes. You're that girl from before, right? You knew? Of course. I was surprised since you suddenly appeared. Hey, Lil. Do you know this ship's crew? Thousand's crew? I see. But, I know where their flag is. You're looking for it, right? Yes. Where is it? Can you please tell me? Will you Play with me? What? Will you play with me? If you play with me, I'll tell you. Sure, I'll play. Really?! Alright! Lately, my neechan hasn't played with me She just plays with him Just with that despicable guy. Extremely good! Hey, Sarco. Seems like we're in great condition! What's with these two? They're not coming at us or attacking All they do is just spin, spin, spin, spin, spin around us. Jump and Kick Arubelle Today's rink Surface is Damn! Jump and Kick You're right, Sarco! My skating is Flawless! Looks like they're not letting us out of here. Oi, Sanji. We'll be in trouble if we don't hurry back to Sunny, right? Yeah Then, do something about these two! Arubelle-chan is so sexy! That's right That's right this guy It's always the same! Damn! Oi! You! You were the ones who took our flag, right?! Where'd you take that flag?! Listen to me! Geez. What's with these two?! If we manage to get these guys' bounties, I think Papa-san will surely be delighted. You're right, Sarco. Without a doubt. It's about time we finish with the warm up. Bounties you say?! As I thought, these guys! Here we go! Love Throw Arub! One more time! Love Throw Onee-san is flying right into my arms! Damn! Hitting me with a lady. What a crappy thing to do. He's the one from before. Yeah. You're the one who stole our flag, right?! The one who stole your flag? Who is that? So, it wasn't you! Then let's go, this is a waste of time. Alright. Besides, it's too cold out here. W-wait, time! Leaving a match unsettled is disturbing! Y-you're right! Our family is responsible for stealing your flag! Where is it? The place? Where was that? If you don't know, we're leaving. W-w-wait! Time! Don't go! Don't go just yet. I'll tell you where the flag is. Where IS it?! My, where was it? This isn't taking us anywhere! Time! Time! I didn't know they had missiles. You're not acting like a man! If you fight fair and square, I'll tell you. It's too cold here. Just get rid of him please. Alright. Let the game begin! If it's about missiles, I won't lose! Just when I found something to prevent cold. It has no meaning like this. Damn! Damn, my field of vision is decreasing. I thought this guy was just messing around before, but I can't hit him while he's moving like that! My movements are being limited because of the cold. If I don't hurry and hit him This is getting boring. If you can't see what's before you, it's pointless! You can't see a thing either! You won't hit me just by shooting like crazy! I-I've been found. Yeah, it's been a while. Well, where might the coin be? Wait a minute. This one! Hey, Lil. What is it? Where could the flag be? So, you won't tell me? I don't know where it is. Hey, hey! I'll tell you, I'll tell you! Really? Really, really! All of the flags are in Papa's room. Papa? Yes. He has quite a lot. A whole room full of pirate flags. A whole room? Today is Papa's big birthday, that's why everyone went to get his present. Is the flag the present? You miss. These are the presents. This man has a 300 million bounty. This one has a 120 million bounty. This man has a 44 million bounty. Oneechan has a 80 million bounty. Gomu Gomu no Pistol Is a flag that important to you? Of course! The flag is our pride! It's more important than anything! Gomu Gomu no Ono Raccoon dogs shouldn't butt into these conversations. We're having a pirate conversation now. Shut up! I'm also a pirate! You you're just annoying me. What can a raccoon dog do? Shut up! Too close, too close. What the? If you beat me here, what'll you do about the flag? If you take me out, who'll take you to Lovely Land? Luffy! Don't worry about that. You'll tell us after your beating. As I thought, it won't be that simple to take down someone worth 300 million. It's better for me to make them follow me to Lovely Land. I understand. I understand now. Just wait a Give back the flag! Bastard! W-wait! Don't hit me. White flag. The truth is that the flag is here. I'll give it to you now! Luffy! Give back the flag! Luffy! You really did fall for that. If you want the real one, try chasing me down! As for you, pirate scum. You better get ready too. Puzzle-san! Puzzle! Luffy! Love Throw They are the ones who stole our flag. There's no doubt. You provoked the wrath of the Great Usopp-sama! Stupid couple! Arubelle! This is what you get for hurting a pirate's pride! Whose partner do you think you're aiming at?! We were having great synchronization! Long-nose bastard! I'm sorry! L-Luffy Luffy fell into the sea! He can't swim, then why? Because of the flag? Luffy! Sensei can't swim either, right? Ah! You're right! You idiots! How can we start this without a flag?! All of you, go search for it! Yeah! Oi, it's about time you return it. There's quite an uproar about the missing flag. Alright. With this flag, I'll become the Pirate King! I've already heard that. But, I think so too. That's why, you're the captain. We'll never lose to anyone. A phoenix flag! What, stop joking If you're gonna run away, stop being a pirate. Well, if you say so. That's proof of the terrific power this flag has. I'm so glad! Luffy-san. I thought you were done for. Thank God! Thank God! Here. Haven't you caught them yet? Where's Strawhats' flag? It'll be here soon, Papa. Relax. I'm relaxed. You're right. Then it's fine, though Well, making the fun last a little longer won't hurt, Papa. Did something pass by just now? No, it was nothing. Maybe you drank too much. Probably. Anyway, make haste about the flag matter. Yes, I'll check the progress. Oi! Also for Strawhat's bounty. Understood, Papa. What's with this place? The winner of this duel will be the fastest! The fastest? Then, I'll give it a try too. Coup de Vent Game over. Super! Seems like I'm out of cola. What's going on here? It's too cold! Quite an attack that was. Sorry. I kept you waiting. I thought of finding a place of refuge, so I tried to make this thing work, but It's not moving at all. It's no use. What's going on? Damn, that rumble was so annoying. And it's so cold too. Stop joking. Rumble? No way! It's all frozen over. You let your guard down. What is it? Yes. Two? Is that so? Fine, I understand. Go! Flying Fish! Well, let's continue. What happened? My third older brother got two bounties. This person. And this person. Hey, hey, let's hurry up and continue. That's right.
