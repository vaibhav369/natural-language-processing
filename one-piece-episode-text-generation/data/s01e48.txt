You've gotta be kidding me! Get him, lads! Captain Smoker? Yeah! You know, he's one of the top soldiers from Marine Headquarters. This town used to be full of pirates heading for the Grand Line. But since the Captain was stationed here, every pirate who comes into the city ends up in the slammer. He's not normal. They say he's a monster. They even say he has the power of the Devil's Fruit, you know. The Devil's Fruit? A job well done, Captain! You finished off the Luffy Pirates in record time! Are you blind, or just stupid? How could these losers be Luffy's? If these pansies are worth 30 million, then it's the end of the world. T-Then what about Luffy? He'll show himself soon enough. And then the fun will start. Huh?

Why would you do such a cruel thing? But I didn't mean to! But I didn't mean to! Please replace them! Please replace them! CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Man, I'm beat I was trying to get to the execution platform, but this doesn't look like the right way at all. Oh well, I'm bound to run into it eventually. Lets see, which way Gold Roger? Old man, are you the owner? The sign outside says ''Gold Roger''. Is that the name of this place? Get out. This isn't a place for kids. And we're closed right now. Out of business? We're not out of business! It's just after hours! Now get out! I was just curious about the name I'm lost. I wanted to go see the execution platform. Can you tell me how to get there? What's that thing on the table? It's a skull! It's huge! This is the skull of a man known as the ''Killer Giant.'' A man who killed hundreds of pirates. He was a devil. But Gold Roger fought and killed him. Gold Roger did? It's a famous tale! He was a big, rough guy, with a big sword! The battle was decided pretty quickly. This gash is what killed him. But he was really something. His last words were.. ''Roger. No one can touch you.'' ''I praise you as the eternal pirate.'' Awesome! Cool! King, of the Eric Pirates The famous gunner Silver-Silver All were very dangerous men. Yet before Roger, they were like scared little babies. Wanna hear more? Yeah! Nowadays youngsters don't usually take an interest in this stuff. I don't care, just tell me more! Pesky kid! Gold Roger Back then No, still today He's the only pirate who truly didn't fear the dangers of the Grand Line. Because you see, the area known as the Grand Line, is a place where ships disappear and are never seen again. Navigation is said to be impossible. Because people are so scared of it, they seldom come close to that cursed ocean. Old man. I want some more rum. The whole bottle. You seem to be enjoying yourself, Roger. Yeah, that's for sure. Because after this, I'm taking off for a little stroll through the Grand Line. I'm so excited. I can't help myself. Hey! Are you really headed for that cursed ocean? Why not? You saying I can't? Well, not really, just I won't stop you, but please, don't go there. They say it's a place no one ever returns from! That's exactly why I want to go. So, some more rum please, another bottle would be good. Saying that, he cleared out all the booze in the bar and set off the next morning, as though there was nothing to fear. Later on, when I heard he had conquered the Grand Line, I was so surprised, I even forgot my age for a bit! But now, everyone has passed on. Roger was executed at the gallows here in town twenty years ago. And from that day, everyone's been going around with the audacity to call themselves pirates. They even call this ''The Great Pirate Age.'' But it's all just a bunch of rubbish Cowards. Less and less people are daring to sail the Grand Line. And so, that is the reason this place will be closed down. I'm going to the Grand Line. Huh? He was cool, huh? Gold Roger. Pirates should try to be like him. That's why I went out to sea to go to the Grand Line and find One Piece. I'm gonna be the Pirate King! That's a crazy thing to say! How could you say that, here in this place? What? But I'm just telling the truth. Kid, after having a customer like you, Don't do that for me. It's decided. There's nothing you can do to change my mind. It's been a long time since I had a customer. Drink's on the house. I don't drink. Is that so? Then how about this? Kanpai to him, to the Eternal Pirate King. To the Eternal Pirate King! So it's you, huh? The usual greeting, eh? Not a nice way to treat an old customer. You ruined my business. I don't feel like joking around with you. You shouldn't think of me as someone who betrayed you. It's not my fault this is the business you're in. The pirates today are all weaklings. That's the real problem. A customer, huh? That's pretty unusual. I'd like some rum. We don't serve your kind here. That's discrimination, you know. Today is a special day. Isn't it? That's the stuff. What happened on that day, even now, is so clear in my mind. Roger, in his last moments. This is Main Street. Wonder if Gold Roger walked along this street That's right. It was a hot, muggy day just like today. On his way to the execution platform, even though his hands were bound, he carried himself with pride. Wealth, Fame, Power. The Man who had Everything in this World Gold Roger. Walking towards his death He held himself high, like a proud warrior. Inherited Will, The Destiny of the Age, The Dreams of its People. As long as people continue to pursue the meaning of Freedom, These things will never cease! Have you any last words? Can you take this off? It's, chafing me. I cannot do that! Why would I run away now? Hmm. That's a little saddening.. Well, go ahead and finish it. HEY! PIRATE KING! What did you do with your treasure? It's somewhere on the Grand Line, isn't it? You have it, don't you? The greatest treasure in the world!? Please, Keep your mouth! The greatest treasure in the world!? Your one special treasure? ONE PIECE! My treasure? All right! That's enough! If you want it, I'll let you have it. Go look for it. I left all of it at that place! EXECUTE!! I left all of it at that place! EXECUTE!! That was the beginning of everything. Hey! This is the new wanted listing. Post this somewhere visible. C-Captain Smoker, sir! Excuse me! Huh? Uhh That Straw Hat He's Monkey D. Luffy! There it is This is the place where the Pirate King was executed. This is the place where the Pirate King was executed. The place where the greatest pirate who ever lived died. The place of the beginning.
