Eneru God is overflowed following the last act of provocation of Sanji. What makes it possible Usopp to help it. During this time, Luffy start to climb Giant Jack for to regulate its accounts with Eneru God. Robin! Does Eneru want the bell, not true? It is at the top is bean, it that? With the right in the middle happy meeting again, having repaired the Arch Maxim, Eneru God its attack begins again. [Note:God of the thunder of aboriginals of central Australia] The guy, turn over to the boat! I will seek Luffy and I catch up with you! Splendid! Do not believe to draw you like that, Eneru! B-brothel! Ca fears! One must leave from here! All will be destroyed! Then it is there that they were. These Shandia warriors tedious and their hidden village. They are originating in the Blue Sea. They surely will appreciate that. Now, go down in the Blue Sea! Our village! Ca could have been us. If we had awaited one little more, we would have died. Lend oath to Large Karugara warrior!  Let us relight the flame of Shandora Wiper Your ancestor the Large Karugara Warrior, had another reason to want with any price to recover our terre natale. Another reason? Yes. For Karugara, it was what counted more. Now listening. The Large Karugara Warrior had a friend. The friend of Karugara? Yes. Karugara, its name was Montblanc Norland! Guides by the sound of the bell! The legend large warrior and of the explorer He was once, he there has very, very a long time Perhaps more than four centuries A history ever written, but always engraved in heart of those which heard it. True story of the warrior regarded as a demon and of the explorer regarded as a liar. Return on the boat! The Demon of Shandora is with our cases! Quickly! Let us weigh the anchor! Let us weigh the anchor now! But Captain, the crew is not yet on board It is an order! Weigh the anchor! You will be eliminated! Leave all and leave. Dear Sir, the daily report/ratio! Admiral, we reached our limits of reserves in food! We go now slowly to die at sea. The cook disappeared. Shit! The remainder of our food The Admiral fell to the sea. It is Grand Line! It drowned by giving up us?! Perhaps that he preferred a fast death with the famine. It is ridiculous! This man returned two time living of this sea! It is a great man. Then, why it laid out its clothing and shoes like that on the bridge?! H-He, somebody could go to see It is impossible! This water is infested monsters! It does not go up Admiral! It was a coriace that one! Here. Euh a cord? Draw it! It is what that? Admiral, you killed this thing under water?! Cook it. To remain sitted all it time with nothing to make deadened my instincts. We are taken in a storm, Admiral! One would say well! I feel the boat to pitch. One would say well?! The rudder is broken! Where is it? The main thing! The main thing! This, my third voyage, has started there is more than two years. It is a miracle which us survived so a long time. Did He, you hear that? Hein? Heard what? You speak about the lightning? Not, rather like the repercussion of a splendid bell. A sound like that. Priest, are you certain? This ground was cursed! If nothing is done, Shandia will fall in ruins! What do we have to make? Can our village be saved? Priest! NR let us must offer we a girl! On the Sacrificial Furnace bridge! How much victims there did it have? More than one hundred. How that may it be? We never saw anything of such! If that can save the village, I will give my body with pleasure. Why do you cry, mom? I will meet God Sun. It is an honor to be chosen for a sacrifice. Thank you to have raised me all these years, mom. MUSE! If it is a bad dream, let to me awake! Make shit! Leave! Leave me! Large Karugara Warrior Seto. I wanted to be like you one day a honest warrior, fighting to protect our ground! I do not want to die like that! I could kiss you, Admiral! We took the direction that you wanted, and of course, here is an island! Ouais, and good news, the storm seems to be calmed. But, really, none you did not hear it? Not, nobody heard bell. Hein? Ouais! You must hear things, Admiral! Here is a quite luxuriant jungle. I hope that one will find beautiful specimens studied. Admiral! Ca must be what you heard, Admiral! He, that is enough! You really believe that I would have confused the cry of this strange bird with a bell? Have-admiral, you have It is not true The tonality is so beautiful Then this island is inhabited. H-He, Admiral! Wait! Somebody is lengthened, there! Oh not! Of the intruders He, you Admiral, there is something of strange with this child! Remain there! Leave me! It is a plague known under the name of Fever of the Trees. It was not treated. NR we let us must leave this island! Doctor, do we still have of Cona? Administrate amounts with this child and with all the crew. It is terrible. Even harvests are infected. Admiral, all the village is sick! CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB Take along the girl on the Furnace bridge! God of the Sun! God of the Rain! God of the Forest! God of the Earth! In exchange of the life of this girl, Please save our village! It is Kashi God! MUSE! You do not have! It can save our village! Kashi God Which splendid form. Please Please save my son! And my father! What? Something fell. What was it? What did it occur? Who is this? Kashi God! It killed God! This ritual is finished. You must be terrified. All goes well now. You do not have to die. Kashi God! Please forgive us! The whole village will be cursed! Kill them! Offer more lives to God! Before we undergo his anger! Karugara! Kill it for us! The Admiral is there really foutu! They have really the furious air! The Admiral does not have all his spirits! He killed a god?! What occurs? We should not be implied in the ritual ones of tribes! Please alleviate the anger of God, Large Warlike Karugara-sama! I am an explorer of North Blue! NOR Montblanc I insane of whom you are! You will be eliminated! Did you always very eliminate like that? Including any form of progress? I will not have a discussion with you! You will pay for your crime! Who is this man? He fights equal footing with Karugara! Now, uses it knife and gives up your life! What? How oses you to cry and request for your life whereas you have the honor to save our village Do not feel you shame?! It is enough! Stop! Have-admiral! Our sacred duty since centuries was to banish all intruders of this island! You have committed the crime unforgivable to kill God! Your life alone cannot not to refund that! We will take your lives with all for expier this atrocity! Then, it is thus that? Life? Sacrifice? Is this that your Gods want? This ritual insults the principles big bosses of the past. I will not let it remain! For these explorers and researchers who traverse the seas for our good with all it is a dishonor! And if your Gods evaluate your lives rightly, this ritual is not it méprisable for them?! Give me time! I will make disappear this so-called curse! And if I cannot, you will do what you will want of us! What?! Dog! You are caught for God?! In exchange, if I can save this village, you must promise more to never practice this ritual! It is all that you have to say? What a nonsense! You will die here and now! Let test it! What do you say? Fate of these men will be decided tomorrow evening. I accept! Then tomorrow evening We all will be killed! Made confidence with the Admiral. He, Miss. Ca must be hard too for you. It is a shame to be born in this village. Ouais, you ace well reason! You would be enough beautiful to marry you with an aristocrat, there from where we come. Ca is enough! Don't you have any tact? This man You speak about the Admiral? Montblanc Norland. Rather a famous explorer. It is also a senior botanist. He traverses the unexplored islands in the search of new species vegetable that he studies then. One could probably consider it like a hero in our country. But it is too nice like guy! It feels obliged to intervene in situations like that! But it is known that one can count on him! Why you do not have let Karugara kill it? You will have the answer tomorrow. He said that he would save the village. We do not lose anything to wait. How you can to be also patient? To be unaware of the words of the Priest and to trust this man Karugara, say something! If I feel the least danger to weigh on this village, I will not wait tomorrow evening to kill it. I do not have the capacity to hear the voices of the Gods. However I can hear the words of a wise man. It is all. Why are you still upright? I am cured. Large Karugara Warrior What did he hear by progress? I found one of them! It is Cona! It was sure that I would find some in a so large forest. It is an earthquake! Ca is there! This time that is there! It is the anger of Kashi God! He, make leave to us! Which disaster. The ground of the forest is very turned over. This island splits itself into two. What a spectacle! It would be said that God chose to punish you itself! Then it would be said that your God is not as powerful as you say it. It does not even have the capacity to kill only one man. You fights still. Afflicted, but could you from go away? I do not want to see your head. I must quickly to go to the village. Amusing. I would like to see that! Try to release you!
