Wealth, Fame, Power. The man who had acquired everything in this world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger. The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas. My wealth and treasures? If you want it, I'll let you have it. Look for it, I left it all in that place. Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line. The world enters the Great Age of Pirates! The bridge is being lowered! Looks like those guys did it. What great timing. T-Trembles from excitement. Robin! We'll save you no matter what! Hurry up and lower it. What an evil looking face I heard you're a bad guy. You're still here? Being publicly humiliated in a place like this Are you really strong? That's none of your business! Geez, I ended up in quite a place just for partnering up with Luffy. The Ways of a Man's Life! Zoro's Technique and Usopp's Dreams You're weak as usual, huh, Zoro? I made a promise. There's no way I can die in a place like this. You again? You must have nothing better to do. I'll untie your ropes, so become my nakama. What was that? I'm looking for nakama to become pirates with. No thanks! Willingly become a criminal? How dense can you be? What's wrong with being a pirate? Pirates are scum, why would I become one? Who cares? You're already known as a bad pirate hunter. I don't care what society says about me But I've never done anything I regret. I will survive no matter what, and I'm going to do what I want to do! Okay But I've already decided that I'm gonna make you my nakama. Don't decide that by yourself! You use a sword right? Yeah, but that stupid son took them away. I'll get it back for you. What? So if you want your sword back, you have to become my nakama! THAT'S BLACKMAIL!! Does he intend to take on the base by himself? After him! Don't let him escape! Major! There's someone in the execution field! What? Rebels coming one after another, huh? Please escape, Zoro-san. They'll kill you if I did that! I can't watch these Marines any longer. I want to be a good Marine. Stop it! I can't escape now! I have ten more days to You're being executed tomorrow. What? Helmeppo had no intention of keeping his word with you from the beginning. That's why Luffy-san got angry and punched him. He did? Luffy-san is currently being chased by the Marines. I'm not telling you to become a pirate. But please Please help Luffy-san. The only one that can save Zoro-san is Luffy-san. And now, I think the only person that can help Luffy-san is you. Hold it right there! You guys have done some interesting things. Are the two of you trying to start a Coup d'Etat along with the Straw Hat? - I have always fought alone. Unlike you, hiding arrogantly behind your henchmen!! Roronoa Zoro. Don't underestimate me. Your strength is nothing compared to my authority! Take aim! I cannot die in a place like this! You're weak as usual, huh, Zoro? Gomu Gomu no Rocket!! Fire! You! Luffy-san! Straw Hat! That's not gonna work! See, I told you. I'm strong! What the hell are  you? I'm Monkey D. Luffy. I'm the man who's going to become the Pirate King! Become the Pirate King? Do you even understand what you're saying? A Pirate King is a Pirate King. Does it mean anything else? I was surprised too! But Luffy-san is serious. That's the kind of person he is! He's going to become the pirate king and intends to obtain the world's ultimate treasure, One Piece! Here you go, your treasure. Which one is it? I didn't know, so I brought all three of them. Santoryu = Three Sword All three are mine, I use the santoryu style. You'll take them, right? If you fight with me now, you'll become a criminal for going up against the government. Or you can be killed by the Marines now, which would you prefer? Are you the son of the devil? It doesn't matter. If I'm gonna die here, then I'd rather become one. A pirate! Yeah! You're going to be my nakama! Great! That's fantastic! Alright, alright! Hurry up and untie me! What is that guy? He deflected the bullets! That Straw Hat is no ordinary human. He must have eaten one of the rumored Devil Fruits. The Devil Fruits? Damn, this knot is hard Oi, hurry up! No matter what the person is, anyone who opposes me will be executed! If guns don't work, then slice him up! Uh oh, that's weird. The knot's getting tighter. Hurry up and give me my swords! Luffy-san! Roronoa Zoro. He's so cool! If any of you move, I'll cut you. He's too scary! I'll become a pirate, that's a promise. And now that I'm opposing the Marines, I guess that makes me a criminal. But let me just say one thing. I will achieve my ambition. Ambition? To become the world's greatest swordsman. But if you ever do anything to jeopardize my ambition Then you'd better make it up to me with your life! The world's number one swordsman That's good. I expect nothing less if you're gonna be a nakama of a Pirate King. Big talker, eh? Then I guess I have no choice but to let the world know of my name, even as a criminal. What are you just standing there for? Hurry up and finish them off! Get down, Zoro! Gomu Gomu no Muchi! (Whip) H-He did it! So amazing! What in the world are you? I ate the rubber fruit. The rubber fruit? He's a rubber man! Just as I suspected, he did eat one of the Devil Fruits. Major! There's no way we can match him! These guys are crazy! We can't even match up with Roronoa Zoro! This is a Major's order. All those that just complained, shoot yourselves in the head! I don't need any weak subordinates! There is definitely something wrong with these Marines. Luffy-san! Demolish these damn Marines! There's no one who can overpower my authority! I'm the Marine Major, Axe-Hand Morgan! I'm Luffy. Pleased to meet ya. M Major! You little brat! DIE!! I don't wanna! Major Morgan is Completely losing What kind of a Marine are you? Destroying Coby's dream like that! Wait! Straw Hat! Look at this! I said wait, didn't I!? Are you an idiot!? I went out of the way to take a hostage and you don't even notice! Helmeppo-sama Oi. If you want this kid to live, then don't move! Make even the slightest move and I'll shoot him! Luffy-san! I don't ever want to get in your way! Even if I die! Yeah, I know. Give it up, stupid son. Coby's determination is the real thing. Don't move! I said not to move, didn't I!? I-I'll shoot him!
