And my pachinko balls will make fear! Besides, where passed teams of Luffy and Robin? The team of Luffy is still there. Robin started from his side. He Ben, this snake sleeps since one good moment now. He danced all during the night. I do not know what made it so happy. But more important still, if they do not leave from here quickly, it will awake and the things will turn to the vinegar quickly. Hein? This so sympathetic snake? Imbecile. You did not see this thing when it becomes insane! This so sympathetic snake? I said just that you say that parce that you did not see it in anger! This so sympathetic snake?

Look at over there! It is Ponéglyphe! Stone that our ancestors have protected with the danger from their lives! But what that said, Chief? Something which it is to better be unaware of. We only have Keep the truth in your hearts, the closed mouth.  We are those who will weave the history,  With the sound of the Large Belfry. How do you know these words? They were registered in ruins of Shandora. You were charged to keep that during generations, exact? You want to say that you can read this inscription?! Having the name of a god, the antique arms, Poséidon. It gives its site. How that? She said ancient! An ancient weapon? Why would she say that? Ouais, why? Another weapon. Different from Pluto of Alabasta. Pluto. Of only one gust, it can destroy a whole island without leaving the least trace. To say that a thing also méprisable tapit still in this world As I thought it, still another dead end. It is not what I want to know. He there! This trick registers with dimensions in does it also form part? What? Gol D Roger. What? I came here and I will carry out it passage au boils of the world.  Gold D.Roger the Pirate The Lord of the Pirates! Ca wants to say that it is come on the celestial island?! But what means this inscription? Not, more important still, how did it know to use this writing? It is the name of Roger? You know it? It is a pirate of the Blue Sea which there came here is more than twenty years. Its name is registered over there? Yes. I cannot know how it could reach this bell But this is the proof that it did it. Now that I think of it There are two types of Ponéglyphes: Those which contain information and those which give the site of the others. These is a stone which contains information. I came here and I will carry out this passage at the end of the world.  To carry out the passage To carry out Would like he to speak about Rio Ponéglyphe?! Chief. This Ponéglyphe has fully achieved its task. Its task? Yes, there is of Ponéglyphes which contains information scattered in the world. By reading them separately, they must form a passage which fills the vacuum in the history. In other words The joined together, complete text. This still unknown text is Rio Ponéglyphe. The Lord of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger must have carried it passage to destination. Therefore, now You known as what our duty was accomplished? Us We will not have to beat us more? I see. The wish of our ancestors was exaucé! Chief! Chief! Hold good! Thank you my god! Thank you my god! He was exaucé! Yes. That wants to say that I must carry the passages of Ponéglyphes which I read to the island with the end of Large Line, Raftel. Say to me, Miss This boy with the straw hat makes me the same impression as Roger. Is this my imagination? Its name is Monkey D. Luffy. I am also interested in him. D? I see. Ca is appropriate to him to have a name of only one letter. Yes, all that will certainly have great historical consequences. Forgive me, Miss. I remember that you were here to find gold. Ca has more value than Vearth on isn't the Blue Sea? Yes. Then why not take the broken column of the belfry? Of course, us let us can give you the Bell. It is an good idea! After all, we must thank you you and your crew for what you did! Ouais, it rightly! Do not be timid. Are you sure? The others will be certainly happy to have it. Yes! Ok! Let us carry that on the boat inhabitants of the Blue Sea! Each one on a side! Ca will be hard to carry! We will give it to savers of our country! Heu, it is enormous. What makes Robin? It spends time of them. Oh, I start to be hungry. The guy, this place is deserted. What occurs? Where they passed warriors and angels? Not, so much better if there is nobody. If they see what one has on backs, they will have some after us! After all, one flew this however to make a station-wagon, not? They will not be very content when they realize some. Nami and Conis have all prepared for our departure. Grouiller is needed. And then, Sanji, you ace not a trick to be eaten? All is on the boat. Go, you must have well something. Give me in. Which wound. Why one would have to await this woman? I will embark on the boat. Cretin, does not even think of it! Cretin! Cretin of Marimo! Marimo Cretin! He, look at! It is Robin! Robin-chan! He, Robin! Quickly, quickly! One slips by! One flew full of gold! Morons! Do not say that! Look behind it! They all return! There is a whole army! Oh shit! Oh shit! One is in a large shit! It is Q-what that?! It is a giant gun! It is a gun! I am sure! Thus they all arrive at the same time. Will run towards the boat! One cannot remain longer! There, looks at! One has full bags to the brim! One is rich! They took all their luggage with them! Me known as step which they leave already! He, wait! Wait! Look at, they have some after us! Cassos! Good, it belongs to me of to stop in their race! You stop there! Not means that one waits! He! You say to them, Usopp! We put our lives in danger to reach the celestial island Quite known as! and to find the legendary Gold City! Robin-chan, quickly! They will capture you! Never a proud pirate would leave the empty handeds! To capture? About what they do speak? One wants just to thank them! Won't He, you take this gold? I think that they do not want any! What?! Flee! There are tons of money! Then, Zoro? I am quite occupied! Ouais, it was impressive! Robin-chwan, quickly! WAIT! Ok, the guy! Will run to the edge of the cloud! OUAIS!
