Come here again, wont' ye? Sanji-san, Sanji-san, Give him this message for me when he gets up Tell him that we shall meet again at the Grand Line. But, you..? I've given much thought into it. It's the only thing I want to do. It's the only thing I want to do. I'm not sure when Don Krieg's ambition became mine as well, but I may only have a few hours to live. It's kinda weird for me declaring my decision, just because I'm running out of time. But this time, I want to do what I want to do. Trusting my instincts. Then I won't have anywhere to run anymore. What loyalty do I have to Don Krieg? I've just been using Don Krieg's name as a shield so I could run away. When your mind's made up, you eventually pay less attention to things like, Being scared of a strong enemy, or how not to get yourself injured. That's what he taught me. Patty! Carne! Patty! Carne! Give him the ship we use to get supplies! What? Are you serious? Why should we give the pirates a ship? How are you expecting us to get our food, idiot?! That's right! People like him should just go swim in the sea! Shut up and just get it already! Fine! Fine! You don't have to shout at us! We're getting it! We're gonna get it! We're getting it! We're gonna get it! Hey, it's sinking! It's gonna sink! In the past, I used to worry about every little detail. I feel so dumb for doing so. I feel so dumb for doing so. See ye. I'll be taking this. I don't have to return it, do I? I don't have to return it, do I? I don't have to return it, do I? Nope. Try if you dare, bastard. Try if you dare, bastard. Hey! Remember now! For this is the fighting sea restaurant, Baratie! What an annoying bunch. They're really nice people. Next time we meet, I wonder if they'll let me join 'em again? I wonder if they'll let me join 'em again? I don't know if I'll even get a chance to. I want to be free! Bellemere-san!
