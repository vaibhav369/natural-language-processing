At this rate The legend of Don Krieg will Don't be ridiculous! What the? It's finally out! Don Krieg's ultimate weapon, The Great Battle Spear! What's that? It explodes Now then How long are you going to run for? Let's see. Hammerboy. This spear is totally different from those tiny ones earlier. After 2 or 3 hits with this, you won't survive. If it hits you, you're finished! What kind of weapon is that? What is that thing? It explodes every time it hits! Huh? What the? My legs The fight's lasted too long. He's lost too much blood. He's not gonna make it. Nothing you do will work. It's about time for your strength to reach its limit. Shit. Since the floor is in so many pieces I can't fight the way I want. What a pain. No matter how many times I see it, that Great Battle Spear is amazing. Yeah, the harder you hit with that, the greater the explosion. It's something that can be used only by someone like Don! That's some strength. Two shields and one spear should weigh about 1 ton, but he's using that heavy weapon so easily! That's the reason Don is called the greatest! Die! Waiter boy! That was close! You Weak Insect! Waiter boy! Waiter boy? Are you alright? Not yet. You've pissed me off. I won't let you die so easily. Shit. That Krieg He Just brings weapons out one after the other. This way theres no chance to Even if he was equipped with a thousand weapons. He may not be able to defeat the one 'spear' that kid has. Nothing special. You should realize who is the strongest here. Life or death. In a pirate's fight, the one who hesitates even for a split second thinking about death can get crushed. What are you talking about? At least At least that kid has no hesitation. Is it that he has what it takes to survive? Or does his conviction mean he simply refuses to die. His conviction? You You damned Amazing! Keep at it! Like I said! This is your grave! I'm the strongest man alive! If Krieg's massive fleet is strength. And his thousands of spears and poison are strength. Then that kids 'spear' is equal to it. That same spear I know someone like that. Someone who would get attached to that 'spear' for his own stupid reasons. The Great Battle Spear! What did you do!? I just punched it five times in a row. Your 'method' won't work anymore! Prepare yourself.
