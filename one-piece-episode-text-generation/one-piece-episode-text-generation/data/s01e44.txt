The man who defeated Arlong? Yeah, he's right over there. Which one? Who? The guy wearing the straw hat. Is that really the guy who freed the island? I found it hard to believe myself. Meat! Meat? Isn't there anymore? They're still working on him? He looked pretty torn up, that Zoro. Well, duh. Any other guy would've taken a year or two to heal! Fool! You tried to handle an injury this serious by yourself? It hurts! Are you guys really pirates? Don't you, have a doctor on your ship? A doctor? Not a bad idea! Luffy But we need a musician first, right Zoro? Why? Because, pirates love to sing. Don't you know? So, why is that more important? Hey Doctor, where's Nami? I don't see her anywhere. Nami, huh? Well, if she's not here, then she must be there. Huh? What's with you, Nami? You're still here? They're looking for you, your nakama. They're looking for you, your nakama.

She wouldn't stop ya. NOJIKO! And even if she did say ''No'', Would you listen? NO WAY! Now I get it What's with you, Gen-san? You two are without doubt, Bellemere's daughters. Gen-san? Nami, you've made up your mind already, right? So just do what you feel is right. Just like your mother did. Bellemere would've wanted no less. Boy, I'm full. It's nice to have someone feeding me for a change. It's nice to have someone feeding me for a change. How's your wound, Zoro? With rest and a good meal, I'll heal up soon enough. That's good. Seriously, why's this stupid party still going on? It's been three days now. Ain't that a good thing? When you feel happy, you should be able to enjoy yourself. Hey Sanji! You were eating some kind of melon earlier. What was it? What about all that meat you've got there in your hands? Oh, that? It's called Namu-Hamu-Melon, because it had Namu-Hamu on top. NAMU-HAMU-MELON? Sounds tasty! W-Where was it? Beats me. It's a potluck party for the whole island, so someone must have brought them He's gone. He's been eating like that for three days. Well, my stomach's full. So now it's time TO PICK UP THE CHICKS!!! I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen! I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen!

Why couldn't this happen before my father had to die?'' ''It's not fair! Why couldn't this happen before my father had to die?'' Or something. Well, I did think that, at first. But now, I'm more concerned about my future. Your future? See, we were saved by the Straw-hat Nii-chan. But starting tomorrow, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves. We shouldn't forget the past, but it's not important now. Rather, the important thing now, is the future. What do we do from now on? What did we learn? We are the future of this village. That's what I've been thinking about. You're too mature! W-Why are you pinching me? What did I do? W-Why are you pinching me? What did I do? Man, I wanted to pick on you a little more. You ARE picking on me! You, you tattooed skank! ''Skank'' is fine by me! Can it be removed? Leave it to me. I've been thinking of how to remove it. But there will be some scarring, it's a tattoo after all. That's the nature of these things. I was stupid. I knew I couldn't take it off. I don't want anyone to see this! ThIs This awful tattoo. The truth is I'm not one of Arlong's nakama! I don't want to wear his mark! Nojiko, what's that? What? Oh, this? It's nothing, just some body art. Just like Nami, Right? Hey Doctor. I'd like you to make a new one for me. Of this. Hey, those guys can dance, too! Song #185 of ''The Praise of Captain Usopp!'' Hey, BelIemere.

We'll work hard, to live our lives to the fullest. We've been through so many hardships. And so, I think I'll laugh to my heart's content, until I look like a fool. NAMU-HAMU-MELON! Eh? There's nothing to eat here. Guess I'm goin' back. WAIT, BOY! Huh? A grave? Someone died? Yeah, a long time ago. Oh. That's unfortunate. Then I should say, ''Gochujousama deshita.'' Or was it, ''Gosuchousama deshita'' Or, ''Gotsujou'' ''Gotodou'' ''Goshuushou-sama deshita!'' Yeah, that '-deshita'. Listen' boy. I know Nami's going to sail with you, to be a pirate. It's a dangerous journey, I know it can't be helped. That's okay. But if you ever take Nami's smile away, I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you. Well, I don't plan on steaIing anything, so UNDERSTAND?! I got it! Sing it again~! Here comes song #368 of ''The Praise of Captain Usopp!'' Who is it? Who is it? The cooolest guy in the wooorld?

It's Nami's dream, right? I'm gonna sail around the world using my skills! And then, I'll make a world map of all the places I've seenl So, this map of our island marks the first step to your dream, right? It's finally over, Bellemere-san. It took eight long years, but we're finally free. Me, and everyone else. It's just like you said BeIlemere-san As long as you keep living, good times will eventually come again. It came true! And now, everyone in the village is smiling, from the bottom of their hearts. Me? I've decided to leave the island! Don't worry, I'll be okay. They're really good people, and pretty strong, too! For the last eight years, I've drawn so many maps. But this is the onIy one I managed to save. From now on, I'll only draw maps for myself. I want to see the world! Together with my nakama! That's my dream. So So, I'm not sure when I'll be coming back. I'm going now, okay? This is the last one, right? Yup! Everything's onboard? Yeah! Alright then. They've stocked us with food. Looks like we're ready. We've only been here a few days, but I feel like we've made so many memories on this island, y'know? Yeah! Aniki's, thanks. We owe you all so much.

I haven't seen her since this morning. What did you say?! She left all the money? The whole 100 million beli? Yeah, she left it with a letter. She's not planning on bringing any with her? But she worked so hard for it! She said she'd just steal more. Once she makes up her mind, there's no changing it. This is ridiculous! We didn't even get to thank her. Nami-san!! Nami! Nami? NAMI-SAAAAAN!! START THE SHIP OUT! Huh? What's up with her? She started running? She said to set sail. B-But! Wait, does she plan on leaving without hearing our thanks and appreciation? She can't-!
