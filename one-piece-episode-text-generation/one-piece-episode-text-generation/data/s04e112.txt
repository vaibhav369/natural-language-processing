Just remember I refused to become your aniki. Yes, Aniki! Move! Move! Open a way for the Pirate Hunter Zoro-sama! Stop it! Those kids are up to no good again.

Are you trying to be rude with Zoro-aniki?! Oi, the swordsman with them, Isn't he part of the pirate crew who helped Iceburg-san? I thought he was a hero, but he's just a fake. You guys sure have some reputation. The townspeople don't understand anything. We don't care what they say about us. I see. Then it's fine. Take care. W-what?! Are you going to abandon your cute little brothers? That's why I don't remember accepting to become your aniki! What was that he said? I couldn't hear it. Oh! What's that?! What? What? Yosh, it's fine now. Aniki! What?! Aniki. Aniki. Aniki. Aniki. Aniki. Aniki. Aniki! We know everything in this town. Trying to escape is useless. You better stop teasing me! That's rough, Aniki.

Elder brother Could it be that, you really think I'll become your aniki? Anyway. After the Aqua Laguna, lots of repairs and housework await us. Aniki, aniki! Hey wait! I didn't agree. Hey! Well, let's go back guys! Yeah! By the way, what's that? That's mom's job. While we babysit, she brings those to the port. Also, most of them go to Galley-La. We have become one nice family. Then, give my thanks to your mother. Are you really leaving? I'm sorry, but I don't have any reason to stay. Nice catch. Aniki. You're pretty good. As expected from someone like you. Oh! He did it on me! Careful. Change his diaper. Oi! Oi! What're you doing? Are you a pervert? I'm gonna wash it. Wear this until it gets dry. W- What's this? I'm counting on you. Yosh! Everyone do your best to finish your duties! Oi, Hoichael. I'm sorry but I Oi! Oi! Stop it. Oi, Michael. Do something about these guys Oi! Michael where'd you go? You're doing pretty well. That's the way. Yosh, stay there quietly now. Oi, Auntie. I'm going back now. Please give back my shirt. What are you talking about? Is there any other place to go back to besides this house? Yeah, my nakama are waiting for me. Don't be silly. Which is more important? Your nakama or your family? Who's part of your family? I don't remember you giving birth to me. We are not blood related. Shut up! So what if we're not blood related?! Is the blood bond that important?! Today I got an order. You came two days ago. I came two days ago and also yesterday, damn it. I don't remember seeing your face. A new family member again? That's right. No. Which one is it?! It doesn't matter. Anyway, don't think Paulie from Galley-La will keep covering for you, Auntie. That's why I returned the loan, right? Idiot, the loan generated interest. That interest generated more interest and made you own us ten times the amount of the loan. That has nothing to do with me. That bill is yours to pay. What'd you say, you damn Auntie?! You shouldn't take this on alone. You can sell one of these kids as a slave. They're not your real family, right? What'd you say?! Now that you mention it They don't look alike at all. That hurt! W-what're you trrying to do, Auntie?! Try saying it one more time! I'll blow off that head of yours! Do it! W-well, we'll leave this place for today. Men, let's go! As expected from Aniki. Good child, Mom is happy. Yosh! Everyone, let's go do the shopping for dinner! Then, it's about time I Hurry up. You're going too. I have work, huh? Ossan, make a better discount. Don't think you'll get a thank you, so make a better offer. You should avoid trouble. Damn. No matter how I look at it, it's weird. Why am I doing such a thing? If I could only get away from them This is bad! You're here too, damn cook! That route is a shortcut, right? Thank you. Geez. They won't come here. Damn, I'm tired. Looks pretty rough. Yeah, whatever. Why do I have to do something like this You?! Damn. Robin! I wonder where Robin went. Robin! You don't have to worry, because I won't tell anyone. Ah! Besides, It suits you. I've had enough! I'm going back. What is it? You wanna go back already? Then, I'll give you the house key. Clean the toilet or something. No! I'm not going back to your house, I'm going back to where my nakama are. Don't say half-asleep things! The one half asleep is you! What's with that way of talking to your parent?! Who's the parent?! You broccoli head! It's not broccoli! It's marimo! Marimo: Moss ball A marimo, huh? I see, it's a marimo. That's righ- No it's not! What're you saying?! Later. He's the eldest son indeed. Michael, Hoichael, bring him back later. Yes! Then, should we be getting back. Yes. I'm thankful for what happened a while ago. Looks like your bodyguard is no longer with you. I think you still owe us a little something. Can you be our guest just for a little while? Hoichael, bring Aniki. They'll surely take us to that place. Who's part of your family? I don't remember you giving birth to me. We are not blood related. Shut up! So what if we're not blood related?! Is the blood bond that important?! Aniki! Aniki, big trouble! Mom has been taken by that loan shark! I'm sorry, but I have nothing to do with it. That auntie should be fine. This time he brought more nakama And also took Michael and our little brothers! What?! You guys, it seems you had some good protection. This time I brought my fearsome brother with me. You better not act cowardly! The Samurai Warrior! He's the captain of the Large Helmet Pirates. With a bounty on his head of 36 million beri. He's Mikadzuki-san! You guys stay back. Keep your hands out of it. I saw when Mikadzuki-san went to the Galley-La 1st Dock to get his ship repaired and was kicked out. But even though he lost to the Galley-La, Right now they're too busy repairing the houses and town and Well, you should really consider it. You're going to fight me? Or are you going to pay your debt to these guys? You should really consider it. I expect no mistakes. Oh! You want to fight against Mikadzuki-sama? You guys have some nerve. What can you do against me, being worth 36 million beri Bam Bam Tornado! Go Mom! Like a technique like that is gonna work on me! You know where the place is? It's the same place they always take Mom. I've already seen it. Damn! Don't underestimate my 36 million head! Didn't I tell you to stay back? Don't do anything dangerous! What're you talking about Mom? We're family. If we don't save you, what will we do? I took you too lightly, idiotic son. Aniki, over there! You guys do the rest. Mom! Aniki! Geez. Die! D-damn it. Amazing! As expected from Aniki. Yosh! Nicely done. As expected from my eldest son. You're still saying that? Oi, Auntie. I'm done with the talking. Listen, it's about time I Are the nakama waiting for you similar to the family at my house? That's right. They're somewhat similar. Then, why didn't you say that earlier?! I said it many times! You're a very precious family member but, I guess I can let you leave the house for a little while. I won't come back. Take care of yourself. Aniki, congratulations on leaving the house.
