Translation and Editing: BOB Timing: Shanks Wealth Fame Power The man who once possessed everything. The Pirate King, Gold Roger. The words that he spoke before his death, influenced people from all over the world to Go out to sea! My Treasure? If you want it, it is yours! Search for it. I left everything I had in that place. Men, in search of romance, entered the Grand Line. The world is currently in the Grand Age of Pirates! I have never seen such a beauty. Then again, I am a mummy, so I don't actually have eyes. Would you mind letting me see your panties? AS IF! This banter He is perfectly copying him. There is nowhere for you to run. Cindry-san would you mind opening that door over there? Afterwards, I would also like to indulge myself in some dinner. W-What? I thought he was going to cut us. That was surprising. What was he planning on starting? W-Whatever! Let's run away while we still can. There is nobody blocking the exit! You're right. Stroll and Hum for Ten feet Arrow Notch Strike! Looks like they did something when we weren't looking. We lost a good man Hey Umm.well That's right. Sanji should be fine. Go! Go! Go, and learn how frightening our master is. Our true boss is one of the Shichibukai, Gecko Mori Ah! I can't say it.  My blood will freeze. Yeah, just letting that name touch your lips will do that. I doubt that the friends you lost are safe. Losing onejust one friend is usually worthy of regret. But when facing the Shichibukai Gecko No, in the face of our master's true power you will fear that not a single person will survive. Quit your damn blabbering! Then, tell this to that idiot Moria! If anything happens to one of my comrades I will kick your ass off this island! Open your eyes General Zombies! Come to life Warriors of all time! Now go! My brave General Zombies! Filled with Animals!? Perona's Wonder Garden. Regardless of where they run off to, capture them and bring them here. They are no match for the General Zombies! Oye! Stop slacking off Captain John. If people saw you now, they wouldn't believe your reputation in life. Aye Aye! I'm going. Geez, what an incorrigible fellow. Ab-sama~ Marry me. Laura! You! Hurry and go help fight! I am the commander you know! Then, marry me. Why? Hey, Laura What are you You aren't going to listen to the Grave Lord Absalom's orders? The, you have to marry me. Screw that! I'm a human. I will take a human wife. Hey Laura think about it well.  You are a female wart hog and a zombie at that. You're dead and rotting away. Stop it! Oye, what a frightening method. Isn't that a Marriage Certificate? To think you want me to marry you without my permission. Ah! I can't take your wild lips any longer! Absalom, stick out your finger for the ring. I love you! Screw you! I don't want to be haunted by a dead animal for the rest of my life. Bride's Martial Arts! Marital Oath Kiss! Bride's Martial Arts! Marital Oath Hug! I love you to death. You are already dead!!! Even though I died and am a rotting zombie, my love for Ab-sama is eternal. Marry me! Like I said, I am I will take this finger! Like I would let you escape, you bastard! I love you! Bride's Martial Arts! Marital Oath Love Attack! Marriage Certificate, seale Wait Laura. Listen carefully. I have already decided which woman will become my bride. Though she has a sharp tongue, she is a weak living human woman. You are going to fail anyways. Unlikely, look! She is one of the pirates that infiltrated the island. She is beautiful and suitable to become my wife. It won't go that way. That woman I will finish her off! Stop it! Wait right there! Laura!!! If that Old Zombie man's inviting us here was somehow seen by this Gecko Moria guy then the Curly browed cook's disappearance may be related to Moria afterall. That stupid cook! It serves him right. But to think one of the Shichibukai was out here. What are we going to do if one of our shadows is stolen? Now, that would be of interest. I-I know nothing. I know I promised that old man that I would beat up Moria. But I guess saving our guys comes first. Like I said, your friends are probably in bad shape. More importantly, you don't have time to worry about others. Stop oinking and guide us properly. You little 'puhi'! Puhi~ What's wrong? No, I think it was my imagination. Oye, bearsy! Bearsy? The Risky Bros are bringing the coffin here. After you get it, deliver it to the Master's Dance Hall. Got it? Did you understand or not?! Don't answer! Not cute at all.. I am going to manage the treasure collection unit on the ship. If something happens, let me know. Got it? That's right.  You are cuter when you are quiet. G-Good Luck. You! Did you just mumble something at me?! A Delivery~A Delivery For our Master! Oh no! We dropped it. This is bad. Our master's delivery has The coffin opened. Huh? Where am Ah! He awoke. Crap! Hurry and hit him. Hit and kill him! Killing would be bad. Then, half-dead! Half-dead! Usopp! Nami! Oye, get it together. Open your eyes. WeI'm sure thatSamurai Did he use the back of his sword? Looks like it rained a bit. The ground is wet. This is? I'm not sure but, those squirrels were delivering us somewhere in that box. OH!!! This is a coffin isn't it? Crap. The three of them awoke. This is bad, let's call our comrades. This seems to be the back of the Mansion. Hogback's lab was on the top floor so we have been moved quite a bit. Oye, behind us! On this side there seems to be an even larger building. What is that? To think there is such a large building behind the mansion. Usopp, Chopper! I know where this is now. What's the deal? Where the hell are we? It is a bridge between the Mansion and this building. Bridge? It is pretty wide if that is true.  It's almost like a forest. No Even for a forest it is strange The fact that we were brought here while we were unconscious means that we were going to be transported to that building? We may have been transported so that they could turn us into zombies. Good thing we woke up. Let's run for it. Yup!  Let's get away immediately. Wait a second. Eh? This doesn't add up. We get completely scared, yelled, and ran helter skelter. But What are you trying to say, damnit? Ah! My "Something bad is going to happen" sensor is going off. Don't say anything. Anyways, let's run away Nami. That's right. That's right. That one time I am sure the zombie said something You bastards! The treasure isn't here! Don't think about pointless things. Let's run! Let's run, Nami! You're so stupid.  I understand. I'm scared too. Your eyes are saying something else though! Then which way are we running? To the back or the front? That's a good question. If we head back to the mansion, I would hate coming across that samurai again. But If we go forward, there may be even scarier guys. Whoa! Ah..? What are these lovable looking little animals? Penguins? Bambo! One Two! Ah..Three. Well Hello,  we are The Penguin Zombie Combi Ah, I got it wrong. Trio! Trio! I am the new guy. Like I care about your line up. And, behind you we have Ah, what? Our friends, the Wild Zombies! Welcome to Perona-sama's Wonder Garden. These guys are freakishly weird! NOOOOO! #AnimeSS@irc.rizon.org Now, we will wring you to death. Chopper! Nami, Usopp. I will stop them here. Well, no matter where we run, we are bound to meet strange zombies. Plus, these guys are animals, so they would definitely be faster than us. This guy looks like a human, but he is an animal. That's right. I am a reindeer. So you are a Zoan type user? He is an animal just like us. If you behave and listen to us, we will let you off easy. What do you mean by "animal just like us"? If that is how you want it, I ain't holdin' back. What?  You guys, bring it on! Here! Owie! W-What, wanna go at it? You damn Zebra Kangaroo! Nomaybe a Kangaroo Zebra Either one works I guess. I will warn you about one thing though. I am the guy who won the World Pirate Boxing Championship 50 years running. With my completely flawless stance, you can come at my anytime. Eat my lighting right! Heh! Not too bad. That is enough hide and seek. Don't look down on a dog's sense of smell. If you are a dog, stop talking. Here he comes. Oh! This is bad. Yosha! Well played. Crap! I'm Sorry! This way! That was close. If you are pissed, then jump over here! And to finish it Don't come. Don't come! You! What now? Have you had enough of Usopp-sama's Sogeking skills? Wait! Wait! Damn it. At this rate no matter how good I am there are too many. Usopp!  Nami! Chopper! Hey Nami! What the hell Usopp, fire! Fire? Huh? Use fire. These guys are zombies too. No! Help me!  I will be bitten! Nami! No! Let me go.  Don't come near me. A zombie's weak point is Hisatsu KayenBoshi! Whoa! It's fire. Save us! It worked a lot better than I thought. Eat this you damn Rub Bear! Ah? Crap! It is a candle. Hot!  Damn itthis is hot. It's fire. This is scary. Put it out! The guy on the chandelier did it. Someone take him out. You! You! That's right! We have that option. Hisatsu KayenBoshi! Alright, once more! Usopp! Chopper! Watch out, behind you! Usopp! Chopper! You are in equal danger. Stop that! You bastard. What are you doing to your comrade? The enemy is that woman. Beat her up! I don't know who or where this lady came from. But, even if it is an order from the master, I'd rather die than kick a woman! If you got a problem with that, bring it on. You damn zombies. Huuh? Oye! What's wrong? Oye, 'Puhi'! Did you do something again? Spit it out! I told you I didn't know anything from the beginning. What an easy to read bastard, you are even snickering. We can't even hear their voices, did they get strangled? Why are your predictions always so depressing?! That is weird Even Zoro is missing now. Damn it. Everyone is disappearing. I wonder if you will be next? That is depressing damn it! Next Time on One Piece: Disappearing Strawhat Crew! The Mysterious Swordsman Appears! I will be Pirate King!
