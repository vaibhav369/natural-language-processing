Who are you? Hein? Hum? Who are they? It belongs to your crew too? Sure Euh. .bien! You also you lost the memory? Is young people and pretty young lady which your first name? It is what that? It is a stag Your mouth species of human! I am a reindeer! He spoke!!! Pfff! Pirates per pirate Ci per there what a stupid time!!! I hate the pirates!

I must leave at all costs from here Pff! I include/understand nothing there but I have anything has to make here. The mysterious boy with the flute The deduction of Robin Navigatrice Phew it is better like that. It is although the bargain hunter left this ship but I think that it will go down on the island. You know the character of our navigatrice, it will not move of the island as long as it will not have made a good decision. I hope for it well Aaaaah I have faimmmm Agyaaaaa!!! That with the air Bonn! Gyyaaaaa!!! Stop! Do really not be nervous for you you Finally one will be able to always think so that one will make after eating. With the fact Miss I still do not know your name. It is Nico Robin. Above could all, you tell us the memories which one lost? OK! There is not question of remaining a second more over there! The pirates can only steal the goods of people It is necessary quickly that I find a means of returning in Kokoyashi. I am content that you would have come large-sister. You are the welcome It is well too calm I wonder what could well occur. If I go up still a little, can be that I will find something Newspapers Hein? Qu what? At wait a little!! Kyaaaaaaaa! What is this you ace you! Your mouth! All depends on these newspapers! I will never give myself them! Hey you I do not laugh! I will never give myself it! The farm! Give me that!

What is what there is big sister? Ah I include/understand, you seek a boat Yes. On this island there are only the boats which are in this port. Good Ah? But there is only of the old dilapidated tubs which do not seem any more to be used?! Everyone seems to be worried by other thing If you think that they is false you can always make the turn of the island. It is small thus I think that will go rather quickly. But good take your time. I am sure that you you will be able to have fun. I cannot waste my time. Ah I include/understand Afflicted Not do not make any you. Aaahh I start to be sleepy I will return at home. Ah! Hey! Go, so long! They are pirate truths! Ahh the clouds are soft as usual An hyena and horse-winged Putainnnn! Why I remember nothing?! Davy Back Fight and the large fortress of the sailors  celestial islands and country of Arabasta sand. Es you sure that we lived all these adventures? Yes, exactly. J. .j' do not believe in it The captain of this ship has a premium of 100 million berrys?!! Say you know others of them? Stories of interesting adventures? I entered this crew in Arabasta. It is damage but I do not know what occurred front. Meeeeerde! What a dommageeee!! Ahh it is not the kind of thing which one manages to believe easily. But the fact is that the site of these ustensiles de cuisine and spices me sied with wonder. Can Robin san, you speak to us about the event which occurred yesterday? Ok! But then with Mister the ship's doctor come too. Hiyaa guiiiiiii! I already said you that it was in the other direction. But euuuh the fermeee you! You are hungry not? Come to eat here. OOhhhhhhh!! Do not say silly things! I do not want to puff out with the human ones! Can you say to us of what you think too? Please, Mister the exceptionally gifted ship's doctor. Idiotic Uhhh! I am at all glad to be flattered! You ace very content air We were advancing in this maritime zone Are Aaahhh Nami sure for you that it is really this road? Do not worry you! The Log installation shows this direction clearly. Don't Usopp, you always see anything? Await very small little. Eh! An island!! It is surrounded by reefs coral. They is dangeureux to skirt the coasts. This evening we will drop anchor and one will unload tomorrow morning. Heinnnn?! You do not want to listen to what the navigatrice says?! Sanji-kun, Luffy is private meal this evening! Quooiiiii?!! Hay! Nami-san! I am desoléééééé!!! And then all the crew left to lie down except Kenshi-san which assembled the guard and me which made research. Here approximately what occurred. You know the continuation. I think According to what you said, the hunter of pirates fell asleep too. It seems to me Another coffee cup? Yes readily. But I wonder well why only Robin-san did not lose the memory If Kenshi-san also slept, the only difference between you and me it is.  the sleep. I slept but I remember very well! We form well part of the crew of large Usopp! Thus that wants to say that the sleep would have removed our memories I did nothing but say what I noted objectively. I cannot affirm it with certainty. I never heard of a similar case. Maintaining it is with you! Speak me about your most recent memory. Me I am to go to gather plantes médicinales with Doctorine, and I was supposed to return to the castle to sleep but when I awoke I was here. Me I hey! Do not be unaware of me! Hum? I was made carry by a large swirl then I disappeared and I regained consciousness I were here. After having finished my job, I went to lay down me but I awoke here. And you do not remember anything after Ca Ah? Hum! Ah! Ah! Ah yes! I heard the sound of a flute! A flute a flute yes yes! Me also I heard! With the fact A child appeared abruptly in front of my eyes Can be that we lost them but only in fact  it is this child who stole us our memories? One cannot deduce that but it is certain that this child is the key of the mystery. Me known as step which one loses all our memories by sleep Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Do not frighten me!! Wait a little! It is only one dream after all! The occult facts that does not exist! Even if it is not the case, one did everything the same dream! Occult fact or not, it is reality! I would not like to frighten you but In the worst of the cases, it is possible that you did not remember even more who you are. Waa I had peuuur! One of fout  to have memories or not. It is true that it is regrettable not to remember memories cools but  it is enough to live again of the adventures together! Do not say stupidities!! It may be that all is forgotten! S if it is the case, all our past and all our dreams go They will not disappear! My dream will never disappear! And that must be similar too for you. Which optimism Huhuhu with or without memories, our captain is always the same one. It is surprising Aaahhh!! My puffs out disappeared!! Hihihihi! Uwaaa! Do not touch with puffs out others! Afflicted Do I have to say that it is stupid or not? I feel really ridiculous to reflect seriously Hihihihi! Where is the city?? IRC:/irc.ff.st/rival-spirits IRC:/irc.fansub-irc.org/kinh IRC:/irc.fansub-irc.org/saiyajin Hihihihi! Ca excites me! Ahh!! What you factories? One. .un new remedy to find the memory. Do not obstruct me. Hey!! Does not touch there without my authorization! You found something? Not it is an ordinary island as one finds some anywhere. Beurk! It is what this bitter trick?! Yosh! It is ready! Huhuhu The great invention of Usopp Master! It is what these tricks?? Héhé good question These tricks are!! One can be reassured even if one loses the memory with that! I named them:MY NAME PUNT!! Huhu. good idea. It is not genti L! I am not a question mark me! And me I am neither a tanuki where necessary nor a provision! [Tanuki:left raccoon] One to coil idiotic?!! Then, that did you say some? Superb not? Ouch! . Stop manufacturing conneries! My memories Are the men so fragile is not this step Zoro? Zoro You ace of the Zoro chance to be a boy. Me also I want to be the best fencer of the world! The girls when it grow they become weaker than the boys. It is not right! Me also me also I would have liked to be a boy! You will say that to me when I overcome you? How if in fact the capacities count!! Zoro! I feel idiotic to involve myself of all my forces! Then repeat that never again! promise it to me! One day or the other, one of us will become the best swashbuckler of the world! It is a race between you and me for becoming it! Idiot be too weak for you. Promised!! Master give me this saber. The saber of Kuina? I will be strong too for it. So that my name is known even in the skies! I will be the best swashbuckler of the world!! I promised to him.I I! hikk hikk sniff. Of agreement! Take it. I entrust the heart and the dream of Kuina to you. After these events I endured hard drives  and I took the sea to seek this man. To become a large swashbuckler. I remember assembled being aboard the ship and to have slept After that I do not remember anything any more Moreover these two sabers are odd When I had them? In more they suit me to perfection. What does it occur? Who is there? The last date of the log book corresponds the day before the newspaper. It is coherent. I cannot believe in it it thus said true? I belong to the pirates? Me? Not it is not possible! And this tattooing But finally that does it occur? I do not include/understand anything any more. More nothing Hyahhahhahha! How are you poor human? From now this island is under our control! It is one day memorable and you will have to buy your life to me! That which cannot pay will be killed!! I do not want why we must leave this village? I want to remain here But as we are poor, one can be the children of Belmer-san more. Wait!! Huh? These 100.000 berrys are for my daughters. I do not have what to pay my share. Belmer! You. !! Excuse to me Gen-san, I I cannot say that I do not have a family [Gen-san:diminutive of Genzo-san] Even if I must die for them It is true that we do not have any family ties but It is my family! Even if they are only words, I want to be their mother. They are my daughters not? Belmer-saaaaaan!! Forgive me I did not can anything make as a mother for you. It is not true! I do not want anything else thus do not die! Nami you must carry out your dream! Remain in life Die because of this ridiculous love. Nojiko! Nami! I love you!! I will belong to the crew of Arlong I will be their geometrician and I will draw charts. Nami I signed a contract  to repurchase Kokoyashi. To repurchase the village? For 100.000.000 of berrys. If I buy the village one could be free. But 100.000.000 of berrys it is an immense sum!! You will certainly not have them, even by working all your life! I will have them  and I will do anything for that!! If I ask of the assistance to somebody there will be still casualties You must suffer Yes To be with that which killed Belmer-san  it is hard. If you remainders alive it will arrive to you full with good things! Do not make any you even if I will see his face, I will always smile! I decided not to cry more! I decided to beat me all alone!! Belmer-san I am in a hurry. This evening I will take all the remainder All Huhuhuhuhuhu! Hum? Thin Ah. I awoke you? Not. You can still sleep. If there is a problem I will awake you. Ca will go, excuse me Robin-san. Do you want a coffee cup to remain waked up? Yes please. On the other hand, those there sleep thoroughly  whereas they said that they were not going to sleep. You do not sleep yet? It is you who stole their memories? Fufufufu you are right. But it is too late. You awake! Quickly!! Ahha! You have a mysterious technique. Ah?? Hein? Hi!! It came! Waaaaahhh!!
