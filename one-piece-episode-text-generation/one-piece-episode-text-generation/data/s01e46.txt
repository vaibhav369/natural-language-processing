And besides, you're treating me to this great sake! That's all I care about Treasure and sake! I really admire that! Man, you are one awesome pirate. A good guy By the way how did you come to be on this island? Ah, I just came here looking for the treasure. What? No way! There's TREASURE on this island? Hold your horses. There's TREASURE on this island? Hold your horses. If I'd found that treasure, I wouldn't be here now. Ah Oh yeah, I guess you're right. Anyway, a lot of things happened. I was left behind by the others, and I've been here for about 20 years now. That must've been really hard on you, huh? Well, I don't know if I'd say that. I still have these guys here, after all. I'm used to it, I've become pretty happy here. No kidding? You find this more fun than being a pirate? Well, being a pirate was fun. It was good. I still feel that treasure's worth risking your life for. Damn straight! Hey, you know, when I collect my crew again, you wanna be one of my nakama? We could use a great guy like you. You've got the soul of a true pirate. So, how about it? You really mean it? You would want me? I'm so glad you said that. But, these animals are my nakama. We've been together for 20 years. Even animals have feelings. I can't just pick up and leave them. What? What's so funny? You know, you just reminded me of someone else who asked me if I wanted to be a pirate. He was a funny young pirate. Hey, dont worry about it, ossan. You're lucky we came here, even if it took 20 years. You're lucky we came here, even if it took 20 years. What if it had been 30? You might be dead by now! Straw Hat! He was a good kid, with a big heart. I bet if you met him, you'd like him too. A young pirate guy like that was here, huh? I've met some really awful kids in my day. Assemble! BARA BARA PARTS! Are you talking about these? Ack! My parts! That's a real thief for you! WAIT! You're goin' flyin', Buggy! GOMU GOMU NO BAZOOKA!! And that's how I started my journey. Just thinking about it makes me fill with hate and rage. Really? That must have been hard on you. Well, there's lots of different kinds of kids in this world. Anyway, tonight, let's celebrate. A nice evening like this shouldn't be wasted on bad feelings. You're right. To pirates! And to our meeting! And to our meeting! KANPAI! Hey, I'm really sorry. Thanks for rebuilding my raft. What? It was nothing. So, you're really going to stay here? Yeah. Together with my nakama. I see. Well, take care! You too! Goodbye, my friend! Take care of yourself! Yeah YOU TOO!! FULL SAIL! Buggy There are many strange sea creatures in this area Try to be careful. THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT TO SAY TO HIM! RUN, BUGGY!! Watch out! Run! Watch out! What's that? SHIIIT!!! Hot damn Who is that? Well, if it isn't a beautiful lady. Well, looks like he's saved. I was afraid for him. Whatever you do, take care!! Man, I really owe you. I thought I was a flashy goner there!
