In Spiders Coffee The meeting of the leaders at 8 p.m. With the kingdom of the Oases. Three years were passed since the last drop of rain. In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons. In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation. With an aim of stopping the rebellious army, Princess Vivi wishes to meet and discuss with her Leader. They have just left the city in ruin of Erumalu, and are on the way for the oasis of Yuba. Eh Luffy! It is what this thing which your brother gave you? Bah, I do not know too much. It is right a piece of paper. A piece of paper? Let see me that. It is really right a piece of paper. It is not a post-it or another thing. For what that is used then? I do not know either EH! DOES NOT EAT IT! Imbecile. Luffy, gives me your hat. Hein? That one?

And an order was delivered in Spiders Café. We must travel towards the City of the Dreams, Rainbase. The man that we call Boss, and we never saw the face  awaits us over there. They should leave for Rainbase about now. I sent Banchi to escort them. They should arrive a little later during the night. Who could have thought that you were Miss Double Finger Miss Doubles Finger I do not remember to have said that I was not it. Did one find substitutes for the Billions which were killed in Nanohana? The substitutes are already in place. I sent Erimaki to deliver the new orders with the Billions. Well. All is well. Ah, over there. I saw something shining. Do we Somme in Yuba? There is so much sand which flies that I cannot say to you. Which is this sound? There is something which bell here! A tempête de sable! Yuba is devastated by a tempête de sable! Oh not They is rather bad This place is hardly worth better than the town of Erumalu. Where is water? It is not supposed being an oasis, Vivi-Chan? The sand level climbed The oasis was absorbed You, isn't this is travellers? You must be tired by your voyage through the desert. I am sorry. It seems that this city is a little bit dry for the moment. But I think that you will be able nevertheless to put back you a little before setting out again. If you seek inns, there is full. After all, it is thanks to that we are known. Excuse me We intended to say that the rebellious army used this city as bases What do you have to see with the rebellious army!? Me known as step which you want to join them! He! He! Qu What? What are you making? You could hurt us! Stop that! Stop! These insane already left. What do you say!? It is not true! You the tempête de sable which has just blown, isn't this saw? It is not the first. These three long years of dryness made assemble the level of sand. And the tempêtes de sable did not stop devastating this city. Absorbed gradually, the large oasis of the past is now in the state where see it to you. Without the trade of the city to help them, the prolonged war of the rebellious army could not continue. They moved towards Katorea. Katorea? Where is it, Vivi? Is Katorea close to us? It is the oasis very close to Nanohana. Katorea!? It is the city where I met Matsuge! When you saved me Matsuge says that it supplied the rebels of the town of Katorea. Why you did not say it to us, dumb of camel!? I you emmerde Do not say Bwwaa like that, filth of camel. Thus we made all this way for nothing? Vivi You have just called it Vivi Ossan = Large father He, Ossan! VIVI IS NOT a PRINCESS OR a TRICK IN the KIND! DO NOT SAY TO HIM, IMBECILE! Es you Vivi-Chan? It is you? You are still in life. I am so content! It is me. Don't you recognize me? I can include/understand I lost a little weight Louse-Ojisan Yes. It is that. Not So long, Vivi-Chan. We will not see we during a small moment. Once the city will be finished, come to visit us! Yes! Louse-Ojisan! Yuba will make this country prosperous, it is sure. It is sure Louse Ojisan? Listen to me, Vivi-Chan. I rely on the King. He is not the kind of anybody who could betray his country. Isn't this? This rebellion is ridiculous! These imbeciles It has not rained for three years. And then? I rely on the King. And a large part of the country too. Many times Many times, I tried to stop them. But no matter what I say, it was always in vain. This rebellion will not cease. Their force already reached his limit. They intend all to stop with their last attack. They are with end. They intend to die! Please Vivi-Chan! Stop these imbeciles, please! Sit of the rebellion Where is the Leader? Inside. Louse-Ojisan. Do not worry you. Vivi-Chan I will stop the rebellion. Thank you! So long, Vivi-Chan. We will not see we during a small moment.
