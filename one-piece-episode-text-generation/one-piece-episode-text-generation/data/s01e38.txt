That's just perfect. I was just thinking about how I'd like to kill you now too. That was dangerous, you idiot! Did you want to kill us too?! Huh? CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Such destructive power It's unbelievable that a human who can throw a monster like that even exists! Is this battle of this world? What the hell did you think you were doing?! Huh? How dare you do that to our crew! Looks like we have to get our hands dirty now Looks like we have to get our hands dirty now I think we need to teach them the difference between our species. So, the main forces have finally shown themselves Arlong-san, please stay right where you are. lf you fought out of rage, Arlong Park would turn to dust. We'll take care of them! Yeah, do whatever you like. Scary Hey, um wait Looks like the octopus is up to something. First, you boil the octopus in salt water, slice, then flavor with olive oil and paprika. It makes a great appetizer. Um, wait, can you hear me out? Take this! SHlKAI-ZERO! TAKO-HACHI-BLACK! You moron! Why didn't you dodge it?! Aah!! I can't see!! And to finish you off Hey! Luffy, run away! Yeah, that's just the problem. I can't seem to move Huh? My feet won't come out! Idiot! Didn't you stick 'em into the ground in the first place!? What was he thinking TAKO-HACHI-BLACK On the Rocks! This is just great Ooo! Sanji! Nice one! Nice one! Looks like I ended up with a complete moron for my captain. We're on the same boat. He's Awesome! Well, at least it's a hundred times better than being with a low-life bunch that hurts a lady. A lady? You came here all the way here for ''that kind'' of woman? You guys make me laugh. ''That kind'' of woman? Say that again, and I'll cook you in a buttered frying pan. Making you into a Meuniere, Fish-man! But a pirate who fights by chivalry can only be mediocre. Why don't you see for yourself, if my chivalry is mediocre? l was raised by an unbeatable pirate. Seems like you're really unfamiliar with the superiority of the mermen race. I still ain't getting free. Not yet? Can't you pull 'em out yet? Not yet. I don't think l can get out just by stretching. Are you even trying?! Are you even trying?! Do you even want to free your legs?! What are those two fooling around for? This is Arlong Park for crying out loud. I'll kill you! Crap, Crap.. Come on, dammit, get 'em out! We gotta get outta here! Wait! Hey, Octopus. Hey, Octopus. Those two are busy. l'll be your opponent. Nyu, Roronoa Zoro! I almost forgot about you! I almost forgot about you! That's right! Then you also killed some of my brethren! l'm not interested in any of that old news. Your reason for wanting me dead I don't care about it. The situation's changed. It's not you who want to kill us. It's us who want to kill YOU! Alright, ZoroI'll let you have that octopus. Nice. Ahh! Luffy!! Huh? I'm back to where I started. Bastard! Goodbye Looks like you really want to be killed lsn't that the guy who saved Gen-san? Aren't you guys from Cocoyashi Village? Seeing that you have all these weapons, I can assume you guys are rebelling? You guys are all KAENBOSHI! Usopp-aniki! Your opponent, is ME! lf you wanna die so badly, I'll kill you right now!! What's with that guy? He stands up to fight, and then he runs away He's a strange one. Get back here, you long-nose! Hey, same with your mouth!! Why did these guys become pirates? Same old, same old. Move! This is getting boring. l just can't stand watching. Arlong-san, I thought we asked you not to get violent here. I'm not going to, I just thought of an interesting game. A game? l'm gonna DESTROY YOU! Do you guys seriously think you can win against us? So what about it? Of course we think that, you idiot! Let go of my hand! Seems like he wants to say something. Whoa! What the, what's going on?! People who possess the power of the Devil's Fruit are dead-weights! Well, even if you didn't have those powers You'd still sink in this situation! He can't be thinking.. into the sea?! GOMU GOMU NO GOMU GOMU NO GOMU GOMU NO GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL! OUCH!! ldiot! Why you! Useless. Luffy! Bastard! l'm coming to save-! Idiot! Don't get worked up! Idiot! Don't get worked up! If you jump in, you'll be right where they want you to be! The mermen have the upper hand underwater! There's only one way to save Luffy. Take care of these guys quickly and then jump in the water? Let's do it! We don't have much time. Right! How many seconds do you think he'll last? That rubberman. Ah, so this is the game you were talking about. I see. The fish is yours. You got the octopus. I'm in troubIe. I don't have any strength to move! Oh no!! He can't do anything by himself like that! Luffy-aniki is gonna die! You can't even breathe underwater. Humans are such inferior beings. Come on! I'm your opponent, you freakin' octopus! Game! A game! I'll finish this up in 5 seconds I'll finish this up in 5 seconds No, 3 seconds. Don't be in such a hurry! No matter what happens, you have no hope of living after this! TAKO-HACHI-BLACK! Hold on! Luffy! I'M DOOMED!!
