Building it! Yosh! Then let's go! Strawhat-san! Strawhat-san! Franky Family! What's wrong with you guys? You're out of breath. To be honest, we just heard about it! Did you see the wanted posters?! Wanted posters? You've been given an unexpected bounty, Strawhat-san! Also, everyone else has one as well! Me too?! At last! Me too?! Me too?! Instead of talking, see it for yourselves.

I-I know these were your motives and you have many many things to say to each other, but Please wait. What we're requesting, is here. Please look at this. Franky! Cyborg Franky Bounty 44,000,000 beri. This is terrible, Aniki has a bounty on his head! It's terrible! That's right. We somehow managed to avoid this, but Aniki couldn't Aniki's life will be in danger if he stays in Water Seven. If he gets caught this time, we won't have the power to save him! Surely, Aniki must be worried about us and doesn't want to leave the island. That's why we all came to talk with you! Strawhat-san, I beg of you! Even if it is against his own will, take Aniki out to the sea! That man was the child of a pirate to begin with! Strawhat-san! We all feel the same! We beg of you! You don't have to say it. I've already decided to make him my shipwright. Seriously?! I-is everyone fine with that too? I-it's fine Of course. That's how it is. I I'm glad! Now that we know that, there's no use staying! Let's go men! Where are you going? The scrap island is this way. I'm sorry We have something unusual to accomplish It's better for you not to know about it. Mozu. Kiwi. You have done what I wanted already. The King of Beasts That Will Cross the Sea! The Dream Ship's Magnificent Completion! You guys, have you made up your minds about Usopp? Zoro. This is a matter of pride I know that. How long are you gonna stay depressed? Why am I the only one with a drawn picture?! That's an amazing amount for the first time. Which part of this picture looks like me?! Where am I in this?! It looks exactly like you â â¡ x â â  â¬ Ò Ó¨ â¼ I can't understand your words I'll be the laughingstock of the whole world's ladies I was tricked He said he was the town's magazine reporter. The picture turned out cute though I also got a bounty after all I'm also a pirate! I fought like a true man! I gotta object to these 50 beri! Well, try harder next time! Strawhat, hurry up! Hurry up! Aniki is waiting! Sorry, sorry. Don't forget anything! As soon as we get the ship and Franky, we depart! Luffy, Sanji isn't moving. Just forget about that curly guy. Wait. Are you leaving already, pirate-neechans? Chimney. Gonbe. Thank you for everything. Exceptions among exceptions, aren't they? For them all to have bounties in such a small crew is The total bounty is over 600 million. By the way This man called Black Leg Why is there no photo of him? That I certainly took it, but When I looked at the developed film, I was surprised This is the picture It turned out weird! Did you take off The lens cap? Aniki! We called them here! Aniki, where are you?! Oh! There's something huge over there! Is that it?! Oi! We came Franky! Please give us the ship! Oh! Ice-ossan! You came Where's Franky? Unfortunately, Franky isn't around However, the ship is complete. I'll show it to you in his place. This ship is amazing. My eyes were shocked when I saw the amazing blueprints; it's one that can sail over any sea. With this ship, sailing to the end of the world won't be a dream. Hurry and show it to us! Please! That was a message from Franky, Strawhat. If you're going to become the Pirate King someday You have to ride this King of Beasts! Amazing! Is this? I see. Oh! So huge and cool! It could break out of so many places! Oh! Are you really gonna give us this?! It's double the size of Merry! What a big sail! Is it a sloop?! Show me the kitchen! The kitchen! A splendid ship! I wonder what kind of big flower is that on the ship's bow. Well, I was sure it was a lion. The inside is also awesome! It's a lawn deck! Feels so good! A slide! You can also do gardening. Nice for relaxing. Where's the kitchen? It must really have mobility with that huge gaff sail! It's called a brigantine sail. A sloop is a ship that can sail beyond people's imaginations. It lives and dies by the order of the navigator. I'll make my skills roar! I also want to take a look. It has the refrigerator with a lock that I saw in my dreams! Even a gigantic oven! Franky, thank you! This ship is the best! Hey, Ice-ossan. Where's Franky? I want to thank him. It seems he doesn't want to see you. Strawhat. You want to invite him as your shipwright? Yeah. You got it right. I've decided he will be my shipwright! That might be the problem. He doesn't want to? The opposite. If he was invited face to face he wouldn't be able to refuse. That's why he went to hide. Well, perhaps his true feelings are to go with you guys out to the sea. You must know pretty well how much he cares for this dream ship he's giving to you. Oh! There's an aquarium in this place?! An aquarium? Amazing! Franky really has a liking for you all from the bottom of his heart. But he's always thought of staying on this island as a duty. If you ask me, it's just a stupid obsession. If you really want him to go with you The only method to choose is To use force to get him. That's the only method for his release. By force? I want him to go, but Is that really okay?! Don't show tears for Aniki's departure, got it? Even if you say so, it's hard, they keep coming against my will Aniki! Why did you come back? Do I need a reason? This is the Franky House! It's my house! But Are you sure of what you're saying, Aniki?! Aniki wants to go with Strawhat-san and the others, right?! What a stupid thing to say Of course not! Hey look! With skills like yours you can't even build a house. We just came from asking Strawhat-san and the others, To take Aniki out to the sea! Idiot! Mind your own business! But that guy has already decided to take you as his shipwright! Why do I have to become a pirate?! You'd know if you could see it! This is the first time we've seen Aniki build a ship, but We were amazed you could make such a happy face. I've never seen Aniki have so much fun. Aniki. You knew the Strawhats were looking for a shipwright, right? That's why you ran away, right?! Look at this Aniki! A wanted poster! As I thought, it came out. It's no use staying with us anymore! We don't want to be a burden to you! Look at this Aniki! A wanted poster! As I thought, it came out. It's no use staying with us anymore! We don't want to be a burden to you! Stop being so cocky! What about the marines?! I'm the one who picked you up from these backstreets when you were dying! That might be true, but However! If I'm not here you probably can't probably survive by yourselves I got his pants! Pants? Why the pants? I see! Don't give them back! Keep passing the pants! Don't give them back no matter what! Give back my pants, damn it! Those are my best! Scatter! Let's go! Fine then! He's coming after us! You know that even you all can't do anything against me! Even if it's just one of you! Deliver them to Strawhat-san! Get them to the scrap island! Strong Right Give back my pants! It's a shame I don't have them. I'm sure I saw them! Don't play innocent! Brother Pass Damn! A fake! Run! To southeast! What's with all the ruckus?! A pervert! Franky is rampaging! Again?! No! The town could be destroyed! He lost his decency! Wait, damn it! Oi! That guy isn't wearing anything! Ah! Look at the! Get the kids inside the houses! Don't let them see the pervert! Strong Right He's committing a crime, arrest him! D-deliver the pants! Get on the yagara! Yosh! Go!

I've never seen such an amazing ship before! Thanks! Pervert! Get out of here! Give him the death penalty! Perverted bastard! Of course! It includes my super designs! It's the answer to all of your requests! Did you see the Soldier Dock System I invented?! Not yet! It'll surely be the one you'll like the most! How about the fish pond? If you put the fish you've caught in the fish pond, you can see them in the large aquarium in the room below. It's an aquarium observation room! Everyone should have a meal there once. You can always eat fresh fish! I'm looking forward to it! That ship, for me and also for you is The supreme dream ship! You bastard! Give back my pants! Chopper! Here he comes! We're counting on you Roronoa-san and the other guy! Leave it to us! Get in! The target is Scrap Island! What're you trying to do?! The Franky Family special product! The Shoot Anything Cannon!
