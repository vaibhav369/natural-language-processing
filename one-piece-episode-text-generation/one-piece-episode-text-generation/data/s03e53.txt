You are in sorry state. This is the man who has dared to defy a god? Of what are you afraid? How? To tremble of fear in front of the unknown To sacrifice the life of people Ca comforts to you to do that?! Comforts me? To sacrifice a life does not have any direction! Since hundreds of years, we live thus! That is not less true! Silence! Foreigner! It does not matter the size of your gods, lives of your similar are crowned much! The sacrifices are on the Furnace bridge! They will be delivered to the Paradise by the ritual of fire! Admiral! They will burn us! To let die of the poor innocent I do not include/understand how you can live with that on the conscience! These barbarous acts are inhuman! To live with that on the conscience?

Look at to me that. He, Karugara. Look at that. Which surprise. This snake had also a grandson. This snake? A snake, hein? Why they are marrent, these deux-là? Whereas they were on the point entretuer there is a few days, the best friends of the world would be said. Karugara is never fact of friend in the village. I never saw it laughing like that. Follow me. We will go down. To go down? The sound of a bell He, Karugara, are this that this splendid sound You will see it whether you are to me. Here they are! Astonished, hein? Here Shandora, the City of Gold. We are them survivors of this city. The Gold City I have the impression to dream. CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB Ouah, there is gold everywhere! This city is a treasure! He, Ho Stop, the guy. They is good. Put aside the belfry, you can take all the gold which your boat can contain. Seto, shows them where the treasure is. Of agreement! You are sure? The villagers are all of agreement. We have a great debt towards you to have saved to us plague. I do not have anything to add. They is so generous of your share, Large Warrior! But, you protected this city during so a long time. It is true. We protected this city. But it is not it treasure which we protected. What we really protected it is this stele. What is it? Writings? One calls that the writing history Ponéglyphe. But we cannot read it. It is not your ancestors who wrote it? All of which we are sure, it is that this city, Shandora a war without mercy endured in order to protect this stele. We must continue to honor affection that our ancestors carried to him. They fought, and as descendants, we must honor the memory with their victory. We venerate our ancestors as much as our gods. But I have evil to believe that this bell can be also large. The tinkling of this bell is a message. A message? It allows the hearts our ancestors who are with the Paradise to turn over on these grounds when they wish it. We sound this bell, thus delivering these words: We are there. The tinkling of the bell represents the last glory of Shandora. It resounds beyond the seas. Never we will ravel ourselves. For this reason this bell, pride of this city, is called the Flame of Shandora. Indeed, the sound is splendid. You find? Of course! This flame has us guided to this island. In the middle of a storm which should have absorbed the sound, I heard it tinkling of this bell. You also, you like to hear this bell to sound? Will you grow as much as this python? Not before a hundred years then! He, you are free to remain as far as you will like it, Norland. since the fall of Shandora. You are the first guests that one receives on this island. Profit fully!

Look at, look at! Eternal Poses! And a chart! Admiral, it is a chart! Last visitors them left behind them. Is this a chart of the island? Yes, this form of cranium is well this island. The name Shandora shows the position of this city. That means the right eye of cranium. Then, made attention. Take care to put back you well. Thank you, Doctor! He, that everyone gathers! Norland will make us to taste funny fruit! There is a greenhouse on the boat. We have the many ones there different plants. We will leave you some seeds and growths to be planted. Does this fruit have good taste? Of course! It is also very nutritive. It is beautiful! Ok, one has a gross day in front of us! Large day of what? With drinking around a feu de camp? Ouais! Why? Why friends of did doctor do that? Chief! Norland and its crew are here! Remember. Do not speak with anybody about but it happened last night! They said that they would take sea in a few days. Reflect before speaking. Never we will be able us to include/understand! It does not matter its medicine, this man is only one killer of gods. They of size are with to ridicule our history? That is enough. Put side your feelings and wait patiently until they leave. They are there! Hello, the guy! Is Karugara there? What is there? Why does everyone leave? Where is Karugara? You, isn't this is foreigners? Karugara said that it did not want to see you. Seto! When do you leave? It would be said that they us hate of a blow. He, wait a little! You cannot to decide on a blow of Enough! Let us continue forwarding. There remain zones of the forest that we did not explore. Was Karugara, you there? Norland passed, and Yes, I do not want to see his face. If I see his face, I feel that I will kill it! They did not sound the Bell today. Yes, but that is never arrived since the beginning of the month. Ouais. Admiral. In two days, we will have explored all the forest. Ouais Say to the crew that we take the sea in three days. Prepare the voyage. Say to them to benefit well from this country before they are attached too much there.
