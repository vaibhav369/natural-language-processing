The words he said before his death, Sent all the people of the world Out to the seas. My treasure? If you want it, I'll give it to you! Find it! I left everything in that place. Men, searching for romance, Pushed forward towards the Grand Line. The world is now In the Grand Age of Pirates! Hey old man, give me a couple of mizu-mizu candies. Right away. Niichan, yesterday's BBQ was the best. Yeah. As expected from someone who uses the best ingredients. Yeah. It's for the best dishes. See ya later old man. Come again! Ah! It's Pirate-neechan. Nami-swan~! Please tell us, how did you two become part of the Strawhat crew? Please tell us, what do you expect being a pirate woman?! It's hard to say, such a private thing. It seems we can't do our shopping. Then, what about your likings? Let's see Nami-san is about to say she likes Sanji-kun. What's Cook-niichan doing? This time, can we take some shots of both of you in swimsuits? Eh? Swimsuits? That'll be a big hit! You sure have some nerve. I-I'm sorry. It'll be expensive. How much can you offer? But, Luffy used almost all of the 100 million beri. We have to make some money by taking shots or something. Wait a minute Nami-san and Robin-chan swimsuit shots Like this? Or maybe like that?! Hey you! What's with that rudeness of yours?! T-this guy is the Strawhat crewâs cook! Sanji-kun. I'll kill any guy who keeps bothering them from now on! Nami-san. Robin-chan. I took care of those noisy people, so be at ease. Sanji-kun, thank you. With this, we can now do our shopping. The chance for a date has come. By the way, about the schedule from now on What about if the three of us spend some time together and look for a nice restaurant Cook-niichan. What is it?! I'm hungry. But you ate a mizu-mizu candy just now, right? I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry! Yosh. If you want to eat, you can do it yourself and then go back. From now on, it might be a date. You just can't come. I don't want to go back yet! It doesnât matter if you cry! It's okay, Chimney. Sanji-kun may say bad things but, He's really gentle with women. That's true. He's not the type of man who lets down a lady. Nami-san. Robin-chan. Chimney. Be good and do as Sanji says. Yeah! See ya. No way! Geez, I can't do anything after that was said. It can't be helped. So, do you know where can we eat delicious food? Alright! Let's go. Sanji Crashes! The Mysterious Old Man and Intense Cooking. Is there really a place where we can get delicious food around here? Yeah! A friend of Baachan prepares it. Of Kokoro-baasan? Cook-niichan's cooking is delicious too but, Grandpa's cooking is much better! It's at that place below the stairs. Geez, such a bad flavor. I heard it was good so I came. And I thought I'd finally get to eat some good food. Yeah. Oi, oi. It's here. Oi Grandpa, make something to eat. Oi, can this drunken old man really cook? I'm hungry! Wake up! Let him be, let him be. Since there are ingredients, I'll prepare it. Heâs got some kitchen here. I'm hungry, I'm hungry! He uses one nice carving knife. He must have some skill. This is it. Sorry old man, I entered. Morning, Grandpa. That way of using the carving knife, Where'd you learn it? Yeah, long ago in the Baratie. Food is ready. Alright! Time to eat! Delicious! You're Zeff's apprentice, huh? What?! The old man knows that shitty gramps?! That way of using the carving knife, Is no doubt that kid Zeff's. Kid you say? That shitty gramps used to be the captain of a pirate crew. To me he's just a kid. So, what're you doing in Water 7? Did you run away from Zeff's shop? That's not it. I'm searching for All Blue. All Blue you say? Yeah. The legendary sea that holds the best ingredients. It's a miraculous sea. In order to get there, I became a pirate. I know. Old man, you know that sea is just a legend, right? All Blue exists. If you're cook, then you must have seen that sea at least once in your dreams. If you've made up your mind, there's no place you can't reach. Up until now, every cook has searched for that miraculous place. It's a cruel sea that even destroys peopleâs dreams. Could it be? So, it isn't a legend after all! Old man, could it be that you have already been there, in All Blue?! No I haven't. So you haven't?! What I was seeing just now was a picture of my younger days. Don't say it as if you're serious, geez. You're such a jester, old man. What? The sake is finished. Thanks for the food. It's for letting me use your kitchen. I'm grateful. Hey, let's go back. I want to eat more. You guys don't know when to stop, do you? Wait, kid. In return for the sake, eat some of my food. You don't have to. I want to eat! Don't act polite with me. Oi, are you okay? Kid, my cooking is really good. Hey, don't overdo it. There's a good doctor Don't cure yourself! Is this old man serious? Oi old man, it's fine if you can't do it. If you want I can Don't interfere, brat! Eh? M-me? Just stay there and watch! I understand, I'll just have to watch. His hands are shaking. He's cutting vegetables with his hands shaking. Pretty good for a drunken old man. Here you go! Time to eat! Delicious! His skills are pretty good indeed, butâ¦ No matter how I look at it, it has no special seasoning. What's wrong, kid? Is it bad? I eat anything that is given to me. Thank you for the food. So damn good! The cooking style is the same The ingredients are no different What's with this flavor?! So damn good! What is it? Haven't you eaten something this good, kid? Thanks for the food! Well no So, can you understand why it's so good? I don't know. That's quite disappointing. If you can't understand something like that, All Blue may remain just a dream for you. Chimney. Gonbe. Wait here for a little bit. Fine. I'm gonna uncover the old man's flavor secret! It's not about the cooking or the ingredients Then, there must be something else! Oh! If it isn't the cook-niichan from the Strawhat crew? Looking for something? Ossan, are these all the spices you have? I'm short on stock. No. Not this one either. Ossan, don't you have more? More? Water Seven is a trading town, But it doesn't have much fame around the world for its seasonings. Geez Maybe that old man made the spices himself. No, that can't Maybe If I get more Damn, I don't get it. Sanji-kun! That's strange. He didn't notice us. Could it be another person? That's right, he's not with Chimney and Gonbe. I didn't notice I got this far. The Aqua Laguna sure did some damage to this place. Galley-La workers, huh? Ah! He's one of the Strawhats. Yesterday was great. Thanks a lot. Oi, everyone! We'll be taking a break. Let's have lunch. Yeah! I've been waiting for it. Delicious! How about it? Would you like to eat too? Idiot. It's rude for you to say that to the cook of the Strawhats. You're right. No, I think I'll get one as well. All of this thinking made me hungry. Oh, then, don't have just one. Have as much as you like. Thank you. But, you guys sure are amazing. To break into that marine base. You're really something. Oi, Cook-niichan, what is it?! Are you alright?! Maybe that grandpa added something weird while he was drunk. What?! Grandpa?! These rice balls! Did that old man make them?! The old man made them, if you have any problem, tell him! I see! Now I understand somewhat the secret of the flavor. I'm so damn glad I tasted this. So that was it. Thank you! Old man! Old man, I get it. What is it, you? Cook-niichan, welcome back. Old man The secret of your flavor is nothing like seasoning. No, it's the basis of all seasoning. The salty rice balls that the Galley-La workers were having, Are old man's doing, right? Is it wrong? No, he's right. But there's still more to it. The problem is, Until now, from all the seas, I've never used a salt like this one. It's not just an ordinary salt, but a fine tasting salt. Why does such a special salt like this one exist on this island? The answer is Aqua Laguna. The existence of Aqua Laguna is troublesome. But its wave has all the minerals from the seas, a special seawater. The salt made from it is a special salt with all those minerals. This is the answer. It's correct. I lost. But old man, To make salt you need a large quantity of seawater. To extract the salt of the seawater from that storm, Without a doubt, there must be a special method. Old man. I want my nakama to always eat the best food. I understand itâs your special salt, But please! Lend me some of your salt. Hey, kid. Nice weather we're having today, right? Yeah. Since the Aqua Laguna incident, itâs always been sunny. There's a place I'd like to go. Think you can take me there? A place you want to go? Kid, please take me to the rooftop of this place. Rooftop? Old man, is this place okay? Oh! It's ready. Ready? That's not possible. Look carefully. This is the place. The Aqua Laguna covers the rooftops. Then, after the Aqua Laguna endsâ¦ What's left behind on the rooftops from that intense deluge starts to dry. Then, After it has dried up, what's left is this. I see! The Aqua Laguna salt. Wait a minute! That means every rooftop in this place is the same?! That's right. All of the rooftops in this place have that salt ready. There's so much of it. Kid, which sea could possibly bear the salt of the Aqua Laguna? There's only one sea in the world that could have it. All Blue. What's this, you've got quite a lot. Is all of it salt? There's still a long journey from here on. By the way, old man, When I got here, two men were coming out complaining. Geez, such a bad flavor. Yes, those guys It's about time they Oi! Old man! Please, prepare some food like the one from before. I thought it was awful food at first, But I just had to come and eat it again. Old man, what's the meaning of this? They ate common food. Sailors are used to eating bad cooking on theirs ships, But once they taste something that delicious, they come back for more. With a weak heart, the body is also lighter. Old man, hurry up, I beg you. Old man. With your skills, why do you quietly stay in Water Seven? I can't leave that salt behind. I see. Well, old man, Next time I come here, I'll bring you some salt directly from All Blue. I see, I'm looking forward to it. Grandpa. Grandpa, is your shop open? Oneesan, if it's for you, it's always open! Grandpa is cute. Water Seven women are really the best! That's the real reason, perverted old man! Cook-niichan, thanks for today. I had fun! The one who should be grateful is me. Thanks to you What? No, never mind. Then, we're going back to Baachan's place. Okay. Be careful. Usopp? What? Luffy, you want me to come back now? Geez, it can't be helped. If I'm not there, you can't do anything. Alright, since you insist, I'll go back to the crew. Maybe it's best if I say it this way. This is the 23rd pattern Oi, Chopper, we're having nice weather today. Let's go fishing! Oi, Luffy, what about you? This one is also good. The "act as if nothing ever happened" strategy. Or I've decided to visit Elbaf! Eh? Please don't go! I was kidding. I can understand your feelings. Will you be coming back, Usopp?! Of course, idiot! Geez, you guys sure love me! What is he doing? That idiot. The food is ready! Delicious! This time itâs more delicious! What's this? Delicious! That's true. This is really tasty. Hey, Sanji! Thank you for this delicious food! Thank you! Well, there's still plenty of it. Hey cook, seconds! Do it yourself! Seconds! Seconds! Iâd also like more! I want more as well. With pleasure~! Kid, the undiscovered awaits you!
