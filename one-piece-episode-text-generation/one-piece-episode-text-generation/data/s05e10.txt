W-what's going on?! Strawhat! I won't forgive you! I'll melt you down in an instant! Nettaiya Nettaiya: Certain nights in which temperature is no less than 25 Â°C Gomu Gomu no Pistol Rocket Gear Second Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol Hana Jet Atsu Atsu Hit Strawhat! Die! Naked Balloon! Shishi Pile On Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling Jet Whip What's this? Lava. As I thought this island is The hot guy That's impossible! I let my guard down. There's no point in prolonging this. Sensei Oi, Robin. Can't you do something with your Devil's Fruit ability? Yes, but I can't tell which one is our flag. Damn it! Can't we do something?! Is this it?! That! What? A bird? What the?! This is! This is! It's our flag! Thank God! It made me worry, damn it! I'm happy for you, Sensei. Jiro! I'm so glad! Alright! Alright! Alright! Found it! Found it! Found it! Found it! Thank you. Robin-chan, let's get going! Since we recovered the flag, it's no use staying here! Yes. Alright! Next step the Sunny! Yeah! Men, don't falter! Give it all you got! It seems like a lie that you used to team up with those bounty hunters! Just which is the real Commander Stancen?! Who knows. But, the Commander we know is this one! Shut up all of you! If you have time to blabber around, put more strength into this! The Captain and Jiro went to risk their lives to get back the flag! We too, shall protect the ship with our lives! Don't let it go no matter what! Protect our pride! We're the Phoenix pirate crew! Yeah! Look at that, nuisances! We did it! Well then everyone, get back to the ship! Roger! These things! Big trouble! The penguins are heading to the Strawhat's ships! They! What's with them? They're retreating! Yo, penguins! It's been a while. This time you'll have to deal with me. Hot! You have nowhere to run now. It's just a matter of time before your foothold sinks in the lava. So I'll just have to beat you before that happens, right? That's simple! How long are you gonna keep ticking me off?! Atsu Atsu no Luffy! Nettou Surfing Nettou: Boiling Water W-what?! Luffy! Trying to escape?! Atsuyaki Tamago I'm melting! I'm not melting. What's going on?! Luffy! Nami!

I'll head to the New World after I beat you up! It seems that those calling themselves "Pirates" are all idiots! Aiming to get into the New World, aiming to become the Pirate King. Just a bunch of dreamers with no fear of death. Thanks to them we rejoice in prosperity! It's no wonder why bounty hunting is the best business to earn money! They're willing to throw away their lives just for something as meaningless as a pirate flag! It's because you're idiots, isn't it?! Shut up! What? Did I offended you? Don't keep talking. Prepare yourself, Naked Balloon! "Prepare yourself" you say? Looks like your last option is just to bluff! However, take a look at the situation! It's as if this were the very same red hot hell! Well, it's no problem for me to keep staying here, but For people like you it must be an unbearable heat as if you were inside a boiling pot. It's no big deal. You're not hot in the very least. There's no way a cooled guy like you could match my own heat. Have you lost your mind? You say you're hotter than me?! Look closely! Who can possibly overcome this red-hot boiling body of mine?! Oi! Shut your mouth and come already! I'll beat the hell out of you! What did you said?! Don't mess around! I told you I'm a 10,000 Â°C man! So what?! My power alone Is burning 1,000,000 Â°C! Gomu Gomu no Very well then! If you think you can do it! Try it! Better watch out, your hands will be melt down! It's not hot! It's not hot! It's not hot! IT'S NOT HOT! That's impossible! Fly!

Roger. Let's do it. Fly! Here we go, Usopp! Make sure to hang it properly on the ship. W-wait a minute! Pondo Hou I'm flying! Leave it to me! Coup de Boo The smell of cola. What're you guys doing?! The flag was stolen, wasn't it?! We gotta hurry to get it back or! Eh? The flag? I wonder what he's talking about. You probably had a bad dream. Isn't it? Oh! That must be it. Luffy, look over there.

Let's get out of this ice field! Let's go! Stancen. Your decision was the correct one after all. Because of my failure as captain, you had a hard time. Are you seeing us, Vigaro? Your death definitely won't be in vain. Men! We're off! Oi! What the hell is happening?! It seems that because of that heatman's fault, the volcano's magma at the sea bottom has become active. Let's hurry. It's just a matter of time before the volcano erupts. Yosh! Set sail right away! Yeah! The island is gone. That was close. Lil. Now, now! Listen to me! The fact that you gave Papa's collection to the Strawhats! Just what's wrong with y! Shut your mouth for a second! Lil I'm sorry. Oneechan! You must have been very sad this whole time. Let's apologize with Papa together for the flag incident. I'm sure he'll understand. We're a family after all. Arubelle. Lil. Good. Good, Arubelle!

I'll take revenge for what you did to Papa, prepare yourself! Campachino! Puzzle! I'll be your opponent! Strawhat, this guy is mine, stay out of this! W-what? You all go on ahead! I'll take care of you at the New World. I'll be expecting your new bounty! Yeah. Of course! You! Amateurs! Let's go! Aye! Jiro! Luffy, aren't you going to help them?! Everyone will get killed!
