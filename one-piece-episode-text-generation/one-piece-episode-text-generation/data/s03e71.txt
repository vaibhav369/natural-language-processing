GOOD-BYE, FORTRESS! The FINAL ESCAPE That fears That fears That fears That fears That fears My unit of attack! You caused us some problems, Sheppard inspector. Their boat is taken with the trap! I let to you deal with the remainder! If they are able to escape, I will hold you for person in charge, Commander! To hold me responsible? No the concern To mention in your report/ratio the name of those having put our operation in danger The crew of Mugiwara They proved to us that they were such as the Admiral Akainu predicted it to me. Thanks to them, in a certain direction, We could justify the importance Navarone fortress. They penetrated an impregnable fortress. To thwart all the traps undertaken against them and they are now always in mare. But it does not matter how much these pirates can be gifted Indeed It is you Sergent? Ah well. Remain in alarm until new order. Yes, Me sior! Remain in Alarm! Yes, Me sior! Commander! You will leave them to escape without anything to make? Please, remain quiet to observe the scene. The échec et mat approaches. But! As I have just said it, it is as if they were already caught. The nine hour old trap crushes has already be install, See. See? But to see what? You venz to say for nine hours crushes If I say it to you it will not be any more one surprised. Yosh! Full right throttle in front! It would be said that our navigatrice is not interested not too so that it occurs. Nami-san! What doesn't go? There is something behind us? The fleet of Navarone follows us closely! God thank you! It would be said that they do not have any after us! They dropped anchor? They undoubtedly declare fixed price. I wonder it They were crushed by our know-how! They throw sponge! Why don't they draw us above, at least? Waits a little, you believe that they manigancent something? It is what worries me too! When it worries, Nami-san It is so beautiful! Commander The hour came! Yes, now follow the orders to the letter. It was Drake? Why you do not have him ordered to continue the continuations?! Why the fleet did drop anchor? It dropped anchor Because it is nine hours crushes. Still this history of hour If they do not drop anchor They will be devoured by the hooks sea of Navarone Hooks of the sea of Navarone? It is what this noise? A river would be said. A river on an island? I did not see any of all the afternoon of it. You see there better, there? Is Nami-san, what it? The rudder does not answer any more! Y' has a trick not normal in this fortress, it changes the conditions weather! NOT! Devoured by the hooks of the sea? Even with the brilliant navigatrice of Mugiwara on board, Their boat will be unable to escape this trap. I never let my prey flee. Then, here is reason. Why do you have the air so satisfied? The first time that one tried to escape, I wondered why they used a so rock port as a base. It is not a little late for that? What really astonished me It is the quantity of water little deep in the port. Normally, they open and close the lock to control the water level inside. They use the periods of low tide, to make sure that nobody fear of entering or of leaving. It is an immense natural fortress! What explains the intervals regular times, during which no boat do not enter or does not leave the base. Nami-san has a deductive power so impressive! Then, one does what now? Yosh! Right in front of the lock! ONE CANNOT, MORON! Full right throttle in front! You ACE LOST the HEAD OR WHAT?! Luffy! Q - What there this master key?! One will fail oneself on the rocks! THE BOAT WILL NOT HOLD!! I knew it! There is a hole in the hull! Oh, not! It is a whore of hole! There is board? What? Water was evacuated. I drown! I Oh, the boat is completely out of water. Oi, that wants to say that That one can neither escape nor to even move. Ca means that the enemy had very planned. I drown I drown! I will drown! The more that goes, the less that is arranged One does what? One gives up the boat and one bars oneself? Hmmm You want to still remake the same thing? It is not the same thing! When the tide will come, the boat will run! With our gold? I will not let that arrive! Help me, please! I have the flagstone! I have the stomach in the heels! Wait a little The Dial Impact! One can use it? Water is rather low Not to have to worry for boat until the next high tide. But we cannot see what the enemy is making. Let us go eat small something! How you can think of puffs out! Look by over there! Mugiwara Luffy! As all its band! HYDRATES DE CARBONE FORCES GIVE " Mugiwara was made take by the nine hour old trap crushes! Even these guy cannot escape with the hooks of the sea of Navarone! What will arrive to them? Eh well you see The captured pirates are always carried out. You should not leave in this state! Dad, you are still sick! Keep silent yourself! My tiredness started from itself! This cretin would do better not to destroy this splendid boat! If it does it, I will botterai the bottom to him! Tanuli-san! Even in the navy, there is a powerful fortress, under the command of G-8 Division I as well congratulate you to have fought. You have admirable convictions, but there, there is échec et mat. Mugiwara kaizoku-da You do not have any more any gleam of espoire to flee. I already anticipated all it of what you think. Here, it is a good boy. Under the authority of the command of Navarone. All the band of Mugiwara will be escorted, and to receive its sentence. Give up the rebellion. Luffy! Mugiwara, You and Roronoa Zoro be sought criminals, Then we must lead you at the General headquarter! You have my word that the remainder of your band will leave itself there healthy and except! However, if you tents to flee, I will be irritated! Too much nice, that! It is me which orders here. You are only one inspector, I would be to you admitting to observe without stumbling. If I do not do anything, I will be nothing more that a insect with the eyes of this old badger. Moreover, I came here to prove the uselessness of this fortress! Excuse to me one moment. CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Here is the answer! The Dial Impact. I have to absorb several impacts since we are escaped! One should be able to leave the boat rocks with that! I see! One could use it for we to leave from there and regain water! But that is likely to take more than only one shooting And with this large hole in the hull, one will run as soon as one is on water. That would be well if one could again to use the takoballoon to fly away. Ouais, it is an good idea! If one uses the Flame and Breath Dials, isn't the octopus will reinflate itself? Ouais! It is an excellent idea! There is not the pieuve The pieuve Pieuve Pieuve Ouais Whore of octopus! I have it He says that he has it He has it He has it Shit, it has it It has it You have it? Ouais, just there! LOOK AT! HOW THAT SE MAKES THAT HAVE you THIS TRICK, YOU?! Eh well, you know, it has us helped to go down from the sky. Ouais, but good you did ace not found that a little dégeulasse? Why that? Let us leave to Octopus-san us to help once more. Of agreement, Mr. Length-Conk? , That waits a little made one moment that I did not see the DIal Flame It was funny then I have played with in the kitchen! It is Chaud! Now, it remains more than to decide who will engage the Dial Impact Why you look at me all like that?! With which it is, this Dial Impact? It is that of Usopp. Isn't this, Mr. Length-Conk? Good, like he says it so well, it is necessary that it does it. You are marvellous, Usopp! I have respect for you so much! How? We will help you! All is regulated! NOOON!!! Sergeant!

But I said to you that I do not like broccolis, carrots and poivr Not! I want to say I have still work to finish. To have taken with the Mugiwara trap and all are crew also perfectly, Isn't it enough for you? All that you have to do now, it is to capture them. Indeed, but they surely go to thwart our plans again. You encircled the sea and the ground, how could they escape? Te you remember how they are entered initially? Hein? It remains to them Sky! All is profiled well! Included/understood! All is ready here! Now, all depends on you, the guy! I do not want! I cannot do it! When I will make fire, that will burn with death! Three! Two! One!

They must be taken alive! It is difficult, like order. To send to them a shooting of warning! If they do not stop, made fire in the balloon! Included/understood! Do not escape to you, Mugiwara. Not yet The first shooting is only one warning. You gave that Commander Sheppard. This type It was barred. Tanuki-san and its band Flew away! What I had said to you! These guy came from the sky! Too much cool! That really resembles a hedgehog! What a brilliant fortress! OSSAN, WITH MORE! GOOD-BYE, JESSICA-SWAN! At this altitude, can they draw us above?

You noticed how all the personnel does base work together? I believe it of what you want to speak. It does not matter, these pirates brought to fortress that which it needed. The General headquarter can think that this fortress survived its uselessness. They can say that it is oversize or even pacifist if they like that. The pacifist word is appropriate to me completely. Most important, it is that us, soldiers, and you, the civil personnel, let us can to help and work together to protect this peace, you do not believe? There are many Pirates like Mugiwara outside. The General headquarter will on the occasion to re-examine at which point this fortress is important. I will not leave any of you on the roadside. You still like me? idiot. But, this type, Crois you that it will write a report/ratio at the General headquarter? It my so put out of me that I have it frapp I of insane! I failed to strike it myself! Eh well, Mugiwara, where will you go, you and your troop? There are people at the General headquarter which narrowly were interested in you. The road which is drawn up in front of you will not be easier. It is brilliant to fly! Until where one will fly? Who knows? Ask the octopus. It is pleasant to depouvoir to profit of a voyage by the airs. But I do not want any more to never see basic Navy. It does not matter where go Nami-san and Robin-chan, it is always a paradise for me! Imbecile! Hein? I said that you were an imbecile! Imbecile! Ok, I will repair the hole in the hull. Ah, but me, I have the flagstone! Sanji, to eat! I am hungry! Ahh, the fortress was interesting!
