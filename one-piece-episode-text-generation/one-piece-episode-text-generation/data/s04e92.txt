What are you talking about? I didn't mention this earlier, but Robin is My long-lost little sister. What? Really? I didn't know, she's never mentioned it before Of course she didn't But it's the truth. It happened more than 20 years ago. I'll never forget it On an island in West Blue, on a nice summer day, Me and Robin were playing together. Oniichan! Oniichan: Big brother We were really close. Robin! We always played together. How's this? We were really happy that day. Until they came When I wasn't looking, Pirates came and took Robin! Robin! Bring Robin back! I never saw her again When she finally managed to get away from the pirates, It was too late. It's all my fault No matter what, I want her to be saved But I can't do it myself So I'll leave it to you Please save Robin! Yosh, just leave it to me! I'll take this key and go save Like I'd believe that, rouga! Robin-chan is your sister? Idiot, tell a more believable lie! Damn, you're a lot of trouble, you stupid woman!
