In search of great adventures, Luffy and its crew have finally reached the celestial island, Skypiea. At this point in time Nami and the others are removed to undergo the Celestial Judgment. Thus, guided by Conis, Luffy and the remainder of the crew took the direction of the island of God, Upper Yard. The Small Corbel! It is a joke?! A corbelâ¦? It is not a bird which goes on water. You can leave it port by the door number 2. You will lead to Milky Road which leads to Upper Yard. It is enough for you to follow it. He, Conis. Yes? Why you tremble like that since one did leave at home? Please, forgive me, Conis-san! It is the duty of our people! Do you want to escape to you well from here? That which called Lobster Super Express trainâ¦ It was me! If criminals are met, one is obliged to lead them to the Earth of the Judgment. Or if not we are killed! I am happy, Conis-chan! I know who you are. Return us, pleaseâ¦ God. Ahead, Small Corbel! On the way for the Sacrificial Furnace bridge Will all go well for Conis? It is criminal now since it tried to help us. Perhaps that it will not be able to live whole here more. This old Knight of the Sky said that it would take care of it, butâ¦ Ben, this Papi odd does not have air to be a bad type. There are not an other choice to trust him. I would have liked to protect it myself, but one did not can have taken it with us. Ouais, it is still more dangerous with us. One goes to the Sacrificial Furnace bridge. And of terrible Ordalies we wait there. It does not advance this tub! This boat is much heavier than Waver. Stop feeling sorry for you! He, look at! What?! It is what this immense forest?! It is surely Upper Yard. TERRIBLE! Did Y have this forest on the chart? Euh, Benâ¦ There is a forest on chart, but it is not so large. Just a normal forest. The type which had this chart was there two hundred years ago. It is even possible that this chart was already old woman. (that it was already old at the time) I would say that it takes at least thousand years so that trees become so large. It is trueâ¦ They are so immense! I want to climb one of them. [The kanji? (kami) âGod meansâ.] It is the entry! Very well, if we want to move back, it is now or never. You ace interest to be ready, Usopp. A-Alors if possible, I would like to retrogressâ¦ ALLONS-Y! You me listenings not! I it has something by there there! Ben, it is a forest. Ouais, it is true. Have-await one second, the guy. Look around us! They are wrecks! Ben, it is a forest! Ouais, it is true. Ca does not have anything to see! Moreover, all these boats were crossed into twoâ¦ E-Encore this noise. You see, there are several types of forestsâ¦ Not, it is not that! TAKE THE OARS! USE THE OARS! BROTHEL! ROW, GOOD BLOOD! LET US MOVE FROM HERE! Hein? Which fly pricks you? A monstrous scythe! DO NOT REMAIN PLANT ! IN HERE ANOTHER! Notâ¦ Not that only oneâ¦ ROW AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN IT!! Q - What brothel occurs?! Attention in front! Slow down, Luffy, quickly! Shit, one will never arrive there! Take the bar, Usopp! Gomu Gomu Noâ¦ What you make Luffy ? You should aim by there! Occupy you! Straight goes! BAZOOKA! One succeeded! OF ACCURACY! There is still? What still?! USOPP, ON THE RIGHT! Not, on the left! Where I go?! Be satisfied to avoid them! Ca never stops! One still will be touched! Ca inflates me! I go all to stop them! [Note: Kazaguruma = Winch] One passed. I hope that it is finished, brothel. It is what that? It is a boomerang! Shit! IT RETURNS! FLEE QUICKLY! This dumb of special-express train we just released here. Which is this place? All that one knows, they is that one find some share in Upper Yard. A Sacrificial Furnace bridge well would be said. A Furnace bridgeâ¦ Sacrificial? Is Nami, it what a sacrifice? It is when one offers alive things with God. Is Oh, it all? I thought that one went to make me boil alive. It IS HOT!! But, it is almost that. Whatever the method, our lives nevertheless will be offered to God. WHAT?! THEN ONE WILL BE KILL?! Chopper! Brothel. It is what that?! A shark. A shark in the sky. It is a celestial shark. ZORO! ZORO!! Bad visibilityâ¦ Where did it pass? It is risky. I cannot use my force as on the dry land. Shit! Shit! Shit! It missed us! It returns! It does not matter the number of lives that one has! This place will be our tomb! I MAKE HALF-TURN AND ONE from GOES AWAY! NOT, USOPP! THE FARM! I AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE SMALL CORBEL! One decided that when?! JUST NOW! The trick it is that one cannot not to even return if it is wished. Look at. IT RETURNS! Good, I have enough of it! Gomu Gomu Noâ¦ What?! Go ahead Luffy! I cannot touch it. In any event, let us avoid it! Is not better to put itself on its road! I believe that one finally succeeded. But what does one make now? One cannot any more to retrogressâ¦ One moved away too much from the entry. You want that one unloads here? MORON! ONE WILL DIE! One would say well. It is what? A snake? It is a lamprey! Or perhaps a celestial lamprey. Considering its size, it would not make not that to suck our blood! It is cool, this forest! There are nothing cool here! All that one meets here tries to kill us! But one hardly has just arrived. As long as one is on Milky Roadâ¦ if one stops to take again our breath, one will find oneself in a beautiful kneader. Our only possibility is to continue to advance. CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB What occurred? Zoroâ¦ Here it is! Zoro! THE CELESTIAL SHARK WILL BEAT ZORO! I they replongÃ©â¦ ZORO DOES NOT REMAKE SURFACE! Itâ¦ was not done to eat, isn't? ZORO WAS DEVOURS! If he had been eaten, them clouds would have become red. WHY IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SAY SUCH MORBID TRICKS, ROBIN?! CA IS ENOUGH!! Brothel. Is necessary to believe that one cannot to escape from here from the stroke. You gave a punch to this shark, and you say yourself epeist. Zoro is too strong! What arrived with your pride of epeist? Firm, woman! There was not one of them! Ca grouille of celestial sharks in bottom! If I must all face them, one there to will have still fallen the night. One will never reach the shore like that. Indeed. And we cannot not to remain here indefinitely. It really misled usâ¦ This large lobster. Perhaps that the Celestial Judgment is to let to us die of hunger here. You believe that God is satisfied of such a sober punishment? I do not know. I ever met. Ca really fears. With a hull in this state, one cannot give it to water. While waiting, finds one means of repairing it, Chopper. Hein? Me? Of agreementâ¦ To repair the boat? What do you intend to make? I will explore the forest. One should also consider this place as our base for the moment. I am sure that Luffy and them others are with our research. You know what one says: âIf you be lost, remain where you are! â It is you which should remain there! He, Zoroâ¦ You said that suited you in this forestâ¦ But what you accounts to make over there? Is God on this island, not true? I am curious to meet it. Stop that immediately! Why want you to meet somebody of also powerful?! Who knowsâ¦ Ca depends on its attitude. Zoroâ¦ is more arrogant than God. These Priests are on this island, them too And you are not supposed to attract you the lightnings of God! It is right good sense! Afflicted, I do not haveâ¦ ever venerated of God. OHHH! TOO MUCH COOL!! I do not believe in a God, then why should I make him prayers? Oh, Lord God, I do not know this man. Please, me do not punish with him! You TOO COOL ES, ZORO! Brothelâ¦ Does Ca thus finish any never? But it did not become yet exciting. These Priests over there must to really want to test us! How that? You want to say that nobody was able to reach Ordalies until now? Ouais, surely. You saw this enormous well flash which fell down on the quay, not true? Ouaisâ¦ I do not know which kind of artifice it has used, but it was terribly powerful. If something of the kind falls us above, one is made like rats. Ouais. This Eneru Godâ¦ Nothing him is known. But it would be said that it us observe since one is there. You want to say that God was in this city? If it were not there, it did not can to use this attack with as much precision. Not, not, notâ¦ I do not know notâ¦ It is God, after all! Perhaps that it observed usâ¦ Perhaps even as it us observe in this moment! Since when you are superstitious? You do not even live here. It is not that the problem. Somebody whom one calls God must be very powerful. One is judicious to incline oneself in front of this kind of guy. Even if it seriously is not done. Then you can speak to him. It is true. But there are other gods in the world which is not so powerful. God of the poor. Or God of the bringers of ill-luck. WHICH YOU SPEAK? It would be said that while one sailed, our next guests decided to come by front! STILL ONE!! It would be said that one can to use this liana. Oh, yes. Good idea. Ca disturbs you if I accompany you, Mister the swashbuckler? They is good, but task of not to trail in my legs. Wait! Where you go, Robin? Look at that. This furnace bridge goes back to it there is at least thousand years old. Thousand? Vestiges of a past if moved back fascinate me. Place such an in charge of history must hide a whole heap of relics. If one finds some spalls invaluable, it will be very useful to our crew. I come too! WHAT?! YOU DID NOT SAY THAT YOU WERE AFRAID?! One will unearth a little history. Its eyes changed into Berrysâ¦ Will that be enough? It is perfect. It is what that? A cry of bravery? Robin is so cool! Ca with the easy air with it. It is a little highâ¦ There are approximately fifty meters. If you tombs, you die. DECREE TO FRIGHTEN ME! It rightly. If I fall, it is foutu. Nami. Of agreement, they is good! I arrive! I go there! TOO MUCH FAST! It IS TOO FAST! I CANNOT STOP! Cheer, you have notch. Afflicted for all these troubles. It is nothing. Should to you have made the cry. It IS NOT CA the PROBLEM! This forest is really immenseâ¦ Good, Chopper! The boat is between your hands! One leaves it under your guard! One will be soon of return! Of agreement! Be careful, the guy ! And return in life! Nami is in safety with Zoro and Robin. Me I am too afraid to follow them. They all are so courageous! I hope that I will become as brave man as them one day. In any case, now I must just make my better. They left me only with boat in a dangerous forest. Ca proves that they make me confidence. I will work hard. Ouais! I am all alone in this dangerous placeâ¦ It IS ME WHICH AM MORE IN DANGER! ONE SE WILL MAKE PUFF OUT! He, you believe that this large trick in good taste if one does cook it with the barbecue? Drop! How you want that I cook in a similar place? Gomu Gomu No Pistol! The alarming celestial islandâ¦ the alarming celestial islandâ¦ You want from to go away? MORON! I WILL BURST! It IS TERRIFYING ! LEAVE ME QUIET! A right giant in front! Not, it is a stone statue. He. Then, it is a cul-de-sac? Not, there are four doors. Do not say to me that zlles carries out very at different places? Ordalie of the Marshes. Ordalie of Iron. Ordalie of Wire. Ordalie of the Bubbles. One can take that which one wants! Then, God proposes a little game to us? Four Ordaliesâ¦ Which goes one to choose??
