The attack of Eneru continue with eagerness, attacking the island of Very whole Skypiea. All this is only one affront! People, trees and ground! It is necessary that they turn over to their place! They will become a rain which will fall down on the Blue Sea! Quickly! Angel Island is on the point to sink! There is no shelter on this island! During this time, Robin and Usopp are still with the feet of Giant Jack. It already took much altitude. In little time, the arch the summit of bean will have reached. What can seek Eneru well up there? He wants the Gold Bell hidden in top. A bell? This old Divine Sanctuary is not useful to me any more with nothing. Nor the city of Shandora in lower part! There is from now on only one thing which interests me in this country! The Large Gold Belfry! Luffy, with the continuation of Eneru, sink towards the summit of Giant Jack. Nami, I hope that you are well! And I will not leave you to take the Gold Bell, Eneru! Destruction of Angel Island! Terrifying descent of Raigou!! The Gold Bell. It is what you have just said, not?

There are not time to speak about that! You saw these flashes, not?! If one does not draw now, one died! At the top of this giant bean. How? How do you know it? He! One promised in Nami to wait its return on the boat! It will bring back Luffy and us to join in little time! It rightly, Wiper. Ruins of Shandora are right in lower part. This bean transpierced it ground right in the middle of the city. He, look at! He! Ruins, finally I do not know what it was, but there remain only crumbs about it! And it is exactly what be likely to arrive to us! The heart of the city it is there that drew up the Large one Belfry, supporting the Gold Bell. It was registered on a chart that I found in the ruins. You are unaware of me completely? To make simple, I believe that the force of impact with bean the Bell high in the sky propelled. It is just above us? Song of the island! He, Ho! Then there is a large bell in is the Gold City, it that? Good, I reached it top of Giant Jack. Naturally, I never needed to explore the sky above the Divine Sanctuary. It has been there for 400 years. Then, where is it? The Gold Bell. It is what this place? Still him? I did not expect that it there arrive with this weight at the end of its arm. Ah! Te here! Do not move! Eneru! Little runt. Wiper, which do you make?

I hope that Luffy and Nami did not fall with! Wiper! Not! Wait! You are too weak! Look at yourself! And even if you succeeded, you could never to reach Eneru because it flies! It is It is just above us! The Bell that the Large Warrior Karugara wanted to sound! Karugara? Yes. It is for that we are there! Eneru I will not let to you take it! Now, how you count to go up up to now? Puffiness! Remainder one moment. You will be likely to assist with something the miraculous one. It is what that? Ah ouais I would do better to benefit from its absence! It is my only chance!  driven yo What it fout? Brilliant, my plan went! Now it is necessary that I go up on this arch! Luffy! I finally found you! Nami? What do you make there? I came to seek you. It is thanks to Sanji-kun and Usopp that I am in life, they saved me. It is true? I see! They is super! More important Wait What is it? The clouds of flashes change form. Sky! The Help!! Oh not! With the assistance! Will run! That it passes?! Embark! Quickly, everyone on board! A giant ball floats in the sky! I have a bad presentiment. Interior of this sphere clouds of flashes is a concentrate of air and of electricity! It is just above Angel Island!

The ancestor of Papi Head-of-diamond If it exists, it is so much better. But if it does not exist, it is so much better too. My goal is not to prove its innocence. It is right a duel with that which ruined my life.  was not a liar. Then this Papi and monkeys in low must know the truth! The Gold City is in the sky! If I make sound the bell They will hear it. Without that, this Papi and these guys will continue to explore it ocean floor and to die about it! Luffy I cannot let Eneru take it!
