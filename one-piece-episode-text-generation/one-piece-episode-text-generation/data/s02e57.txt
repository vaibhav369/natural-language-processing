The wishes of the despairing people are being crushed beneath the dry cloud of sand. Some peoples looking for hope, some peoples hope for a little chance Their resolves have gone astray, and in the confusion, The Curtain of History has been drawn on a tragic climax. Nami has been battling against the Toge Toge abilities of Miss Doublefinger. Although she seems to be at an insurmountable disadvantage, Nami has gradually begun to understand the power of Usopp's invention, the Clima Tact. Meanwhile, Crocodile appeared at the Palace, And has finally revealed to Vivi and Cobra the final objective of his evil ambition. Secret of the Royal Family! The Ancient Weapon, Pluton. What did he mean? Pluton? What is he planning? Pluton. It is said that with one shot, it has the power to wipe out an entire island and all of its inhabitants. A weapon bearing the name of a God, the most fearsome ancient weapon in the world. And it lies dormant within this very country. An ancient weapon? This country harbors something so terrible? Father, did you know of this? The secret passed down through the Royal Line That has been my true objective since I began this venture. With it, I will create the world's most powerful military nation upon this very land. Then everything you've done has been for that ambition!? When I become King of this country. I'll have no problem recruiting pirates from far and wide. As I gain power, I will surpass even the World Government. A country out of a dream! The World Government will never allow you to succeed! I know, that's why I need the ancient Pluton. I don't care how you came to hear that name, But not even I know where it is hidden. I am not certain if it is in this country or even if it exists at all! I see. I thought that might be the case. I've already planned for that possibility. The uncertainty of its existence is undeniable, even to me. Audacious fools. Crocodile is holding Cobra-sama captive inside! We must rescue Cobra-sama! We need the full force of the Royal Army! We must get inside! But with those hands sprouting from the door, we can't break it down! If we don't do something about those hands, we'll never get inside! If everything moves according to plan, In 20 minutes, the Rebel Army will reach the Palace Square, And a battle will ensue. And then, in one half hour, at exactly 4:30 I've arranged for a giant bomb to be fired into the square. Are you insane!? The bomb will generate a blast five kilometers wide. I'd imagine your lovely scenery is going to change quite a bit. If you do that! Both the Royal and Rebel Armies will be obliterated. They will fall and their war will be over for all eternity. You should be happy. You've worked so hard to see this rebellion end. Destroying the Palace is far too crude a method. It's so much more efficient to annihilate them all in one fell swopp. How can you do this? WHAT HAVE THEY EVER DONE TO YOU!? You! You!! Vivi-sama! Worthless. Stop this! What can you possibly gain from doing this!? Vivi-sama! Now then, Mr. Cobra. I'll ask a different question. Where is the Poneglyph inscribed? Poneglyph How do you know about that? If I tell you where it is No I will take you there. Papa The words of a wise and benevolent ruler, Cobra. You're a clever man. Vivi-sama. I cannot stand this any longer! Remember, Nami, The Clima Tact draws its power from your intelligence. In your dire moments, use your head to survive! That's our real weapon, right? Heat Ball, Cool Ball I can use their individual characteristics and combine them to attack! That's the Clima Tact's power! And last of all, Tornado Tenpo! This is your weapon's final feature! Tornado Tenpo No human opponent will survive a hit from this BUT! You can only use it once, so make it count! If you miss, it's over! If I miss it's over. You mustn't look away from your opponent. You've got quite an interesting weapon. But without having any actual fighting ability behind it, It's nothing more than a toy. And if you're trying to kill someone, the only things suitable are weapons! That's what you call them. If I stand still, I'm going to die! The final attack, Tornado Tenpo! I have to- G-Give that back! I can't be killed by this little toy. I bet a wool sweater would generate more electricity than this. You won't know until I'm done! Give it back! I have to think This one-shot Tornado Tenpo I just have to create an opening so she won't be able to dodge it! I think. What can I do by combining the three kinds of bubbles and this country's arid climate? If there were only a little more moisture in the air Moisture That's right! There was a rain technique! A water show? She's lost her mind. No dammit! I have a plan! Oh come now. I'm getting bored of your little party tricks. The party's getting exciting. Let's start the real fun. An urchin! You'll be as full of holes as a bee's nest! That doesn't look like a bee's nest. The wall's smoldering! As gratitude for your little show earlier, I'll let you see something interesting. Now's my chance! The hot air should absorb all the moisture and rise higher. It'll collide with the descending cold air and rapidly cool off causing the misture to condense! Then Didn't I tell you not to look away? Whaaat, these wounds are nothing. I'll keep fighting till I die. Even if my arm torn from my body even if my nose is shattered into a thousand pieces, I'll Don't talk so much or you'll start bleeding internally. Yeah, yeah, I know So you guys made it through alive. Sanji!                            Sanji! You're all beat up So? How was your fight with Mr. 2? You need to ask? My goggles! You got them back for me! Thank you, Sanji! You're so thoughtful- AHH! OI, WAIT A SEC! THEY'RE BROKEN! You jerk, these are the lastest model from North Blue! Do you have any idea how much they mean to me!? Oi, look over there. Listen to me Those must be the reinforcements for the Rebel Army They're still coming? Looks like it. Vivi-chan might be the only one who can stop them. Ah, shit! Vwo! "Vwo"!? Hey, where the hell have you been hiding, Eyelashes? Let's hurry to the Palace! We might still be able to help Vivi-chan. Gotcha. Oi, Usopp! Come on! Right Oi, Eyelashes, let me on! Look, look! Can't you see the condition I'm in!? Eyelashes, stop! LET ME ON! Godness, looks like the only thing you're good is running away, honey. That's right, the bubbles There it is! It's kind of small but I made a cloud! What are you talking about? It's not enough, I need to make it bigger! Enough of this! You! So? Ready to die yet? I should ask you. What a bluff. Unforgivable. What!? Today's forecast calls for comfortable himidity with a slight breeze. Expect a sunny day accompanied by high atmospheric pressure. With the exception of one area where mirages and whirlwinds have been cause for worry. Beware of tornadoes! Tornado Tenpo is your weapon's final feature, But you can only use it once. If you miss, it's over! If I miss it's over. Tornado Warning! I'll decide this, with my final attack! I've always wanted to fight like this! For that sweet girl's sake Nami-san Please don't die Try risking our lives along with yours! WE'RE YOUR NAKAMA! What? So it turns out you do cry. You're the one suffering the most, And you want to beat the hell out of him more than anyone. It summons the clouds! It causes the rain to fall! It even makes the winds blow! My miraculous Clima Tact will decide this match! I'll use my ultimate attack! For Vivi! Are you alright? Your left leg is causing you quite some pain. You can't even stand up anymore, can you? This is nothing! This doesn't hurt! It doesn't even itch! Do you even know mow much she's been through!? Compared to that Giving up one leg, or two legs, or three legs IS NOTHING! Now taste this. What? What? What? What!? The doves tied me up! I did it. I did it you guys. Usopp, Vivi! Ah-hah. I finally remember your ugly mug. I vaguely recall a bounty hunter well known in West Blue. Am I right? They called you a truly magnificent and notorious assassin But you're just someone's dog. What are you fighting for anyway? Little dog of Crocodile. Did you lick his hand so you could get a good treat from him? Bastard. You fight for money. Pride also has a bill. Get ready to pay it. So your body is as hard as steel. If I can't cut steel, then I can't cut you either. As you say. Striking and cutting attacks will not affect me. I see. That's a pain in the ass. And since I can't cut steel, I can't beat you. Then what will you do? Well! I'll pity you. What? A predicament like this is just what I've needed. I've been itching for a chance to get one step stronger. When I beat you I'll have become a man who can cut steel.
