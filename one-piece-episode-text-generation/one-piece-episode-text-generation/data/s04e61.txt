One Piece Treasure Sweepstakes! The first letter is this! The way to win will be explained at the end of the show! I won't let any of you pass through this door! The men of the Franky Family were trying to open the way, having to pass by the two giant gatekeepers who suddently appeared at the Main Island Gate, Oimo and Kaashii. Timber Hitch Tug Paulie and Zambai reversed the situation and were about to succeed in forcing the gate open. On the other side, Luffy who already passed the Main Island Front Gate was unavoidably facing retardement from the enourmous amount of military force there. Five people? You mistook it for only five people? Geez, can't you even report properly? Five hundred people Lucci's party was taking Franky and Robin in the Judiciary tower where Spandam was waiting. It's great you returned! Lucci Kaku Blueno Kalifa It's sexual harassment. Just because I said your name? You guys did a really good job on your five years mission. That's right! It's not like a reward for this job but I have something to give you. Mah, we'll put that aside from now. For now, let me meet with them. With the whole world's hope. And the Straw Hat's party boarding the Rocketman was making its preparations to break in. Guys, the time has come! It's getting late, how about we go? Samurai-man! I leave that barrier to you! I'll take care of it. Hurry up and enter! You too! Chapapa PA! This couldn't make me happier! Good job on surviving that incident eight years ago, Cutty Flam. And the woman the whole world considers a threat, Nico Robin. Open the escape road! The Rocketman flying through the sky! I feel great! It's too bad, the people of the world may still not know at what point our achievements today were glorious. As a matter of fact, it may still take a couple of years until those events are known. If you ask me, the justice of those old men is still too soft! You can't achieve your goals without any sacrifice! We are working the best we can to atteint peace for all humanity It's okay to kill those fools who hinder our work, as sacrifices for the grand peace. Everyone should just give us what we demand obediently, you giant As outlaws for the Justice, it's evident they should be killed! Evident, evident! I'm getting pissed off! Tom-san threw his life away to protect the plans! Because idiots like you exist! What are you doing!? Help me guys! Kumadori! Yoyoi! What are you saying? Hurry to save me, oi! Saa, saa, saa! Yoi!

I just woke up! Judge! Enies Lobby's presiding judge: Right! No need to hide it, I am Enies Lobby's presiding judge! I am the one who writes with the left hand, Left-Baskerville! I am the one who writes with the right hand, Right-Baskerville! And me in the center, I'm Center-Freeway! Why's that!? J-Judge! There is a pirate alone making a mess in the Main Island. It seems we can't get in touch with Chief Spandam. Please take commandment in his place! A pirate, huh? A pirate is guilty! Stop saying such things, let him be innocent! Then I'll take the neutral part. DEATH SENTENCE! Why's that!? We are in trouble! Judge!

Guys, seems like there's a modification in our plan. Samurai-man is telling you to hold firmly onto something in the car. So he said! To hold firmly onto something? Why? Hey, stupid swordman! Did something happen? The Main Gate was closed. What did you say!? This is bad, we'll really crush in there! What do we do? What do we do? WHAT DO WE DO!? We can't dodge it! We'll get killed!
