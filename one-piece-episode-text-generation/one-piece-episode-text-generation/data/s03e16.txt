They have fishing, these guys! It is done! They took one removed rust from and they are already on feet! And even while Chopper look after their wounds They recover drôlement quickly! Why you did not accompany it? Hein? But it is what your problem? A blow it is does not fight!  The other, it east fight!  Then, does not go there!  And Go ahead!. It is not what I wanted to say. But you also, you are taken a beating, not? A beating? It is not as if they were across our way. I do not like to fight adversaries which make me pity.

Then these types made fall Sir Crocodile, one of the Captains Corsairs Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro. Santoryu Ougi! [secret technique with three sabers] Sanzen Sekai! [Three thousand worlds] To strike a man in the back is humiliating for a sword-man. Admirable. EXCEED me! RORONOA ZORO! Then as that these kids attracted attention of the World Government, hein? CYB3RFR34K-ISO SKYPIEA-FANSUB Holy Land, MarieJoa How? The Russet-red one? Yes, its intrigues become worrying. Lastly, it is not like if it had moved in person. Exact! It is about an action indirect using a messenger. But all the same! A meeting between White Beard and the Russet-red one is really dangerous! [Note:Sekai Seifu Saikou Kenryouku = greatest political authority in the world; Gorousei = the Council of the Five Seniors] Hum. It is exact, indeed. However, if we let the Russet-red one become insane furious, it could escape our control Nevertheless, it does not have the ambition to change the world with him all alone. Satisfy we to observe it without making hasty decisions! In the immediate future, which imports, it is the problem of the Seven Powerful Corsairs. We must quickly find a substitute with Crocodile. It is advisable to fill this vacancy. If the Three Great Capacities came to to crumble, the world itself would fall of pieces. Measures should be taken. Well! This is why we have already convened the Seven Powerful Corsairs. But I am unaware of how much enter they will answer the call. They are pirates after all, they make any only at their head. Rotten Crocodile With your schemes, you have us put in a delicate situation. And as regards this man who overcame it We cannot any more leave it to run the seas with impunity. Monkey D. Luffy. Arrival with MarieJoa, District General of the Navy Seven Powerful Corsairs Donquihote Doflamingo-sama Follow-up of Bartholomew Kuma-sama. [One of the Seven Powerful Donquihote Corsairs Doflamingo Ancienne precedes:340 Million Berrys] [One of the Seven Powerful Bartholomew Corsairs Kuma Ancienne precedes:296 Million Berrys] H-He! Stop What takes to you?! It is not me! My hands do not obey me any more! Stop your conneries! It is not the moment to joke! It is not a joke! I do not control myself any more! How if I went gober that! Ca is enough! What you have both? You want to kill me?! BUT NOT! Stop! Where you believe you?! [Amirale Defect of the General headquarter of the Marine Tsuru, Chef d'Etat Major] He! Ca is enough! I know that it is you, Doflamingo! Stop that immediately! If I do it, say us what one has to say and let us stop with this stupid meeting! H-He! Stop, idiotic! Stop! Slacken them, Doflamingo! Dumb! Enough! Cease these squabbles! It is a war which you want? [Admiral as a Chief of the General headquarter of the Navy High Ordering Sengoku Marine the Buddha] Ah yes, all my excuses for my delay. I am happy that you came. Rabbles of the seas. And well, terrible opinion that you have us. , Want you start? I guess that nobody any more will come. In to have joined together two on six exceeds already my hopes. You astonish me! I did not want to come either. But the businesses go so well on the island which I am désoeuvré. Therefore, here me is. I see. It is rather painful to hear. There is nothing more opposing to learn that the businesses of the pirates go so well. You are of provocative mood. It is not worthy of Buddha, that Admiral as a Sengoku Chief. I believed to hear a futile discussion. Would I be misled to me in place? Eye of Falcon! The General headquarter of the Navy and Seven Powerful Corsairs A roundtable with two groups of power equalizes in conflict great interest with my direction does not have. Ben, known as thus! You stays well the last that I expected to see arriving. I would never have believed but you What? I am here only in so much that simple observer. I am interested in certain pirates it will be question this time. It is all. In this case, will not see you objections so that I assist with this meeting me too? Lastly, not completely in as long as simple observer. Good god, but which are you? How you entered here?! And well, I did not expect to see so many prestigious characters brought together here. By chance  this meeting  I came to assist to with it  and to take share there. I learned that Crocodile its place had lost and I wondered to times you whether would not seek a successor to him. You You would be Laffite?! Laffite? Oh, I see that you know me. I am very honoured. It was a famous guard peace of West Blue But its inclinations for the ultra one violence cost him the exile. It is old story. But what you think of me imports little. I came to propose a certain person within the Seven Powerful Corsairs. Shanks Ca makes a long time that I did not hear this name. Then like that, this is letter of Shanks? Yes. It appears that it is very important It thus sent me to be ensured that it would arrive at good port. Congratulation. Ca did not have to be easy to arrive up to now. Not, it was my duty as new recruit of the Pirates Of the Russet-red one. [Pirates Of Russet-red (New recruit) Rockstar, Premium:94 Million Berrys] But, that made a few times that I officiate in piracy. I must say that I am rather famous. He, you over there! You already intended to speak of Rockstar, not true?! Not, that says anything to me. And then, he said that the King of the Seas was the best thing than it had ever tasted Wait! Q - What! To send a letter to me to me! Since when this kid he believes so important?! He, But wait! Okashira specified well that this letter was very important! [Note:Okashira = Chief] O it is in the train of to speak about Russet-red there! Es you conscious of what you do?! I am White Barbe! Captain, you drank alcohol too much. Idiot! I drink when I want to drink then that cannot make me of evil. Okashira said that this letter was urgent! I guess what it acts. It is about Ace and Barbe Black. You will say to this snotty-nosed kid of Carrot Hair that if it has something to say to me, it would make to better bring to drinking and to point itself! You can lay out now. I have to better do than to discuss with a small scrapings like you. Mug of cake! [The man most extremely of the world. The large one pirate Beard White Edward Newgate] Always also dry, the old man! Y' does not have what to laugh, Okashira! I suspected that would happen like that. Give me more time! Me had ever been humiliated kind! He, Ho! But what do you say? Drop! You made ace of the good job. Now, returns! But my honor is ridiculed! The life is more important that honor. There is no more only you can make. You gave him what to reflect. Then? What goes one to make, Okashira? One moves! Prepare the boat! One will see White Barbe? Just. You believe that the Government will remain without anything to say? I am not done any for that. What? The Government that will surely not tolerate But if they are put transversely from our road, that will heat! Ahead the guy! Will have action there! Ouaip! Take our better rum barrels! Teach? Yes. It is the name of the Captain of our pirate crew. Ever intended to speak. If nobody know it it could never be used for to impress the other pirates. Exact, we of it are conscious. Moreover we prepare one small operation to cure it if ever you give us a little more time. It is amusing! He! Give them a chance, Sengoku! The crew to which I belong name the Pirates of Black Beard. Try to remember you! Did He, you hear? It appears that Bellamy was made demolish! By which?! I found that 30 Million it was not sufficient for a kid with so much of ambition But, as long as that Whereas will be done, Capitaine? He, jerk! Remain not planted in the middle of passage like a large dung! It is not the moment to irritate me this evening! Crush! I am not interested in small fish! It is at least a head with 100 Million that we needed! I aim at the gold mine! And it is already moving! One finally will go to claim our reward! Captain! We were not to find Laffite in this city? [The Quartermaster of the Pirates of Barb Black. Champion Jesus Burgess] It would seem that its future was some share elsewhere. It is the destiny which wanted it! Isn't this, Auge? [Note:Trough = Eye (German)] [Captain of the Pirates of Barb Black. Black beard Marshall D.Teach] [Tireur d'élite of the Pirates of Black beard. Supersonic Van Trough] Exactly! The human existence is in permanence controlled by the destiny. [Ship's doctor of the Pirates of Black beard. The Reaper Doc. Q.] Papi Head of Diamond! I bring back gold for you! Await me! Soon I will be soon of return!!!
