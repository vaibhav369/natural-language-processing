I'm gonna I'm gonna join Arlong's gang. Nami! Nami! Back then. I just couldn't believe what you'd done. Back then. I just couldn't believe what you'd done. So I questioned Nojiko. From then on, everyone in the village knew. That in order to save this village, you joined Arlong's gang. But, we pretended not to know, But, we pretended not to know, so that if you ever wanted to run away from Arlong, our hopes wouldn't pull you back into his gang. Can't be What are you guys talking about? Are you saying that the whole village is in on the theft and wants to be arrested? Is that it? We're saying that we are fighting for our own lives! Because you Marines can't be relied upon! If you've no intentions of saving this village, then get the hell out of here! If you stick around, you'll be Arlong's target as well! Arlong's target? I wonder You still haven't found it? It's not like we're searching for a grain of rice! It's 100 million beli! Hey, you bastard! How do you know the amount!? Ah. 100 million. Well, I just had a feeling it would be around that much. Don't tell me Don't tell me Arlong sent you here?! Who knows As government officials, We're just doing what's necessary to persecute thieves. You corrupt bastards! How could the Marines stoop so low as to be pirates, lapdogs!? Arlong! It's here! This is amazing! That little girl sure did gather a lot! But it's all stained with blood and in bad shape. Who cares? Money is money. And one third of this is all mine. Don't touch it Don't touch it Don't touch it Nami! Don't touch it DON'T TOUCH IT!! Nami. Nojiko! NOJIKO!! A pinwheel, huh? That was so cool. Oh! I just thought of a good move! Doctor! Doctor! What happened, Gen-san!? Nojiko's been shot. By who? The Marines. Marines? Nojiko? I I'm fine. Arlong was collaborating with the Marines. What? He turned his back on Nami eight years ago, and never intended to keep his promise. What!? What? That means That bastard! Our Na-chan! Na-chan Nami Yo, Nami! What's up? Can I help with something? You're STILL here?! This is none of your business! Get off this island!! Arlong Arlong! Arlong!! If there's money involved, I would rather die than break a promise. I don't care how many years go by, l will keep my end of the deal. ARLONG!! What's her problem? CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Arlong!! Yo, what's up? My prized map surveyor What's that look on your face? Those Marines you sent took all of my money. Didn't you say you would die before you broke a promise involving money? Right!? WHY!? Exactly when did I break our promise? Don't play dumb! You used the Marines to When did I break our promise? Tell me. Dammit Dammit! Dammit! Is that so? All of your money was taken away? That's unfortunate. However, a promise is a promise. Unless you bring 100 million beli before my eyes, I can't release that village. You scum! It's only 100 million beli. You can just gather it again. Or are you gonna escape? However, you know if you run away, I kill everyone in this village We pretended not to know. So that when you wanted to run away from Arlong, Our hopes wouldn't pull you back into his gang. Running away finally? It's okay if we don't chase her? Chase her? Why? There's no way she'd escape. She can't forfeit the lives of the villagers. But what a devious trick that was. I can't let a refined mapmaker like Nami get away. But still, I'm not a demon. Once she draws up maps of the whole world Then, I'll set her free. And how many decades will that take? She can die hundred times before finish it! Okay! Let's meet up with Luffy as soon as we can! Hey, Sanji. What are you doing? I'm cherishing this happiness. What are you talking about? Nami-san has suffered a lot. Much more than anybody. And I'm going to take away all that suffering. Is there anything better than that? Your motives are obvious. Love Cook. That is what a real gentleman do for a beautiful and suffering ladie What's wrong with fighting for somebody beautiful? We're doing this for everyone else in the village too. Shut up. Quit bickering. Let's go. This is as far as it goes! Get your weapons! We're gonna fight! YEAH!! Gen-san Everyone Please! Don't be rash! You can't die! Everything will be over! You have to survive! Or everything will be over!! Eight years ago, we said we'd never throw our lives away! That no matter how bad their abuse against us became, As long as Nami was fine, We were going to continue our fight of endurance! But this is how they answer back! Now that there's no way for this village to be free, we have no goal to survive for! Furthermore! We will not forgive them for preying on Nami's kindness!! Are there any objections!? No way! Let's go! We're already prepared to fight! We're not gonna take it anymore! YEAH!! Wait' everybody! YEAH!! Nami! Just wait Just wait a little longer! I'm going to try again! I'll get the money again! It'll be easier this time! I have lots of experience! It's okay. You don't have to worry! Compared to that time I don't want anyone to die anymore! Everybody, I'm fine! I'm fine so That's enough. We know what futility is like. You fought well, for our sake. It must have been more painful for you to join that crew, more painful than it is to cut yourself. You fought well. Gen-san Now, leave this village. Gen-san! Do it, Nami! I can't! Na-chan. Nami You've got brains, and you've got a dream. Nojiko! Everybody! I won't let you! Stop it, everyone! I don't want to see anyone get hurt anymore! You're gonna die. We know. It's useless. We've already decided in our hearts. Out of the way, Nami! Let's go, everybody! Even if we can't win, we'll show them our pride! YEAH!! Arlong. ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! ARLONG!! Ar! Luffy What do you want? You don't know anything.

You! Go away! Go away!! Go away!! Go away!! Go away!! Go away! Go away!! Go away Luffy Help me. DAMN RIGHT!! Don't touch my treasure! Luffy We're going. Right! Hey! Are you guys okay? Were you beaten up by Arlong? Out of the way. We've come to see the mermen. After finding out the truth about Nami-aneki, There was only one thing left to do, beat Arlong. With that in mind, we came here. But, we lost easily. No offense, but we ain't moving for you guys. You, who have no chance of winning. What? We're waiting for ''those guys'' to come. ''Those guys''? Bet your life on it. ''Those guys'' will definitely come! There!! Them Those guys? What about them? If those guys can't stand up to them, Then there's no hope, not only for this island, But for the whole of East Blue. Remember the faces of those four, that have come to change the future. Move. Hey, do you think those two idiots were part of Zoro's gang? Zoro's gang? They were far too weak. They weren't even worth killing. So true. What the? Which one's Arlong?
