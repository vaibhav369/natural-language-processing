I don't recall saying that I was one of them. I don't recall saying that I was one of them. I don't recall saying that I was one of them. I was merely cooperating. I was merely cooperating.

Where's your ship? We still have it, but Zoro, Usopp, leave right away! Fetch Nami using their ship. Never mind. Let it go. Never mind. Let it go. Never mind. Let it go. There's no need to chase that woman. I can't be without her as my navigator! Fine! What a pain-in-the-ass captain Hey Usopp, let's go! Zoro-aniki, the ship's ready! Luffy, what about you? I haven't fully repaid this restaurant yet, so I can't go. Do be careful. Things here are abnormal. Yeah. I know W-What? What's going on? W-What? What's going on? The ship's been split in two! The ship's been split in two! The ship's been split in two! The ship's been split in two! The ship's been split in two! The ship's been split in two! Look! Over there! It's him! Don Krieg! It's that man!!! The man who destroyed our fleet! The man who destroyed our fleet! The man who destroyed our fleet! The man who destroyed our fleet! That man is That man is That scum He's come this far to kill us! He's come this far to kill us! He's come this far to kill us! He's come this far to kill us! We're doomed! Zoro, who the heck is he? Zoro, who the heck is he? The man I've been searching for, The man I've been searching for, Hawk Eyes Mihawk. Hawk Eyes Mihawk? The strongest swordsman in the world! That's the guy who instantly sank Krieg's fleet of 50 ships, which should've withstood the Grand Line? And he Just destroyed another one of Krieg's ship! But, he looks no different from any other ordinary person. And he doesn't seem to be armed with anything special. His weapon's on his back. His weapon's on his back. No way, you can't mean?! He destroyed that huge ship with that sword?! He's the great swordsman, Hawk Eyes. A swordsman, above all of the world's swordsmen. A swordsman, above all of the world's swordsmen. I never thought I'd be abIe to meet him so soon. Finally, the destined time has come. Finally, the destined time has come. Finally, the destined time has come. Finally, the destined time has come. Finally, the destined time has come. Finally, the destined time has come. Bastard! Why did you attack us? To kill time. Bullshit! W-What?! I'm sure I was right on target! It deviated. He redirected it with the tip of his sword. That's ridiculous! Hey! Who the hell are you? Swords, three of 'em! Could it be..? I've never seen such graceful skill. A sword with power alone is not powerful. So this ship was cut apart with that sword, too? Of course. It's clear now. You're the strongest! I've been sailing the seas to face you. What's your mission? To be the best! Fool. You've got time to spare, don't you? Let's duel, shall we? This guy is Zoro! The ''Three Swords'' Roronoa Zoro! What?! Pirate hunter, eh? That guy? Hey! Things are getting worse, Luffy! Going Merry is about to be gone from our sights! Hey Luffy! Duel? Such a pitiful weakling. If you really were a fine swordsman, You should've been able to Judge the difference in strengths without drawing your sword. Challenging me Are you that brave? Or simply reckless? This is for my own ambition! And for a promise to my fallen friend The world's greatest swordsman Hawk Eyes Mihawk vs Pirate Hunter Zoro. What kind of fight will it turn out to be? No one can win against Aniki! Aniki's the best! Hey now, what's the meaning of this? I'm unlike those idiots who use their all to hunt rabbits. Though you're famous enough to be called a swordsman, this is the weakest of the four oceans, East Blue. Unfortunately, I'm carrying nothing smaller than this. Quit mocking me! Just don't regret it when you die! You're but someone who's yet to experience the real world. DEMON CUT! Wh..what?! Zoro! Aniki's demon technique was broken! But, that has always worked 100% of the time!! What in the world happened?! I can't move! What just happened? No one could avoid this technique before, but just with his toy, he No one could avoid this technique before, but just with his toy, he Is this really happening? Is a strength like his really this far away? That can't be! It can't be this far away! The world shouldn't be this far off!! This can't be happening, Aniki! Please fight seriously! Aniki!!! It can't possibly be this far away! CYB3RFR34K-ISO CYB3RFR34K-ISO Such unrestrained skill. Just with that thing, he's taking on all of Zoro's three swords! That's a monster superior to monsters! I I didn't come all this way to lose against this toy-like thing! Zoro! You're lucky, Zoro because you're a boy. I want to be the world's best too! If only I was If only I was born as a boy. After defeating me, don't you dare say such demeaning things! That's too shameless! You're my ultimate goal! Zoro? Promise me. That someday, either you or I will become the greatest swordsman in the world! Promise me! Promise me! It's a promise! It's a promise! To become the greatest in the world To become the greatest in the world I have to become strong, for her sake too. My strength will even reach the heavens! I'm going to become the strongest in the world! We promised I will If I could just defeat this man What's your mission? Why do you seek the ultimate power, you weakling? Aniki's a weakling you say? You damn bastard! I'll teach you a thing or two! Stop! Yosaku! Johnny! Don't interfere! Just hang on! Luffy? I can't afford to lose! TIGER TIGER That's great! The world's greatest swordsman, eh? As the Pirate King's Companion, if you're not at least that, I'd be in a dilemma. HUNTING PREY! Do you wish to have this go through your heart? Why don't you step back? I don't know. I'm not sure why myself. But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises, and many other deals 'til now, will all go to waste and I'll never be able to return before you, ever again. Yes, and that's called ''losing''. That's why I can't step back. Even if it means death? Death may be better! What strong will! Preferring death over defeat. Kid, announce your name! Roronoa Zoro! I'll remember that! It's been a while since I've seen such strong will. As a reward, A gesture to a fellow swordsman, I will wield this ''Black Sword'', The most powerful sword in the world, to end your life. I appreciate your offer. It's out! The sword that cut the ship! This is my last chance. World's number one or death? World's number one or death? That's enough, Aniki! Please stop! THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE! THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE! THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE! THREE THOUSAND REALMS! THREE THOUSAND REALMS! I lost. Losing wasn't something I'd ever imagine possible. So this is what it is to possess the greatest power in the world? What now? Attacking from behind is a shameless act among swordsmen. Well said. ZORO!!! Don't rush your death, young lad. Zoro!! Aniki! Why? When I decided to become the greatest swordsman in the world, I've already discarded my life. When I decided to become the greatest swordsman in the world, I,'ve already discarded my life. When I decided to become the greatest swordsman in the world, I've already discarded my life. That guy and his stupid ideas That guy and his stupid ideas His opponent was the true world's greatest. The result was obvious! Why didn't yougive up your ambitions, realizing inevitable death? It's simple! To abandon your ambitions! This is Grand Line's power?! The world's power? Even the Pirate Hunter Zoro didn't stand a chance! Damn! Damn! DAMN IT! Aniki! What the hell is that? That kid's got the ability of a devil fruit? Bastard! You're the young swordsman's comrade? Thank you for watching over him. Rest assure, that man's still alive. Aniki! Aniki! Say something! Zoro! Zoro!!! Hey, quickly get him on the ship! Hey, quickly get him on the ship! Here's some medicine! Apply it quickly! It's still too early for you to die. My name is Juraquille Mihawk! Find your true self, true world, become stronger! No matter how long it will take, I will await you in my strongest form! Surpass this sword! Surpass me! Roronoa Zoro! Aniki! Aniki! Say something! For Hawk Eyes Mihawk to declare such words Kid, what's your mission? Pirate King! That's a difficult path, harder than surpassing me. Like I'd care, 'coz I'm gonna become one anyway! He's alive! He just lost consciousness! Aniki! Aniki! Say something! Zoro! Aniki! Luffy, can you hear me? Yeah! Sorry for worrying you. If I don't become the greatest swordsman in the world, you'd be in a dilemma now, right? Aniki! Don't say anymore! Aniki! I will I will never LOSE AGAIN! Until I defeat him and become the greatest swordsman, I'll never be defeated anymore! Any problems with that, Pirate King? None! Good team. I hope we meet again. Hold on there, Hawk Eyes! Didn't you come for my head? East Blue's greatest, Don Krieg's head? That was my initial intention. But I've had more than enough fun. I'm headed back to sleep. It may have been enough fun for you, but I haven't done my bit yet. Don?! Why is he intentionally stopping him?! Die before you go! A true fool. He got away. Usopp! Luffy! Get going! Take care of Nami. Gotcha! Me and Zoro will definitely get Nami back! You Just make that cook one of us! Then we'll make a party of five and head to the Grand Line! Yeah! Now go! Men! With the interruption gone, the real fight has just begun! Let's get that ship! YEAH!!! Old man, if I get rid of 'em, can we call it even? Do as you please.
